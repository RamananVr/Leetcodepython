LeetCode Problem #1808: Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are tasked to find the maximum number of nice divisors of an integer `n` that can be obtained under the following conditions:
1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `n` has exactly `primeFactors` prime factors.
3. The prime factors of `n` can be repeated multiple times.

A divisor of `n` is called nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`.

Return the maximum number of nice divisors. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints:
- 1 <= primeFactors <= 10^9
"""

# Solution
def maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Helper function to calculate (base^exp) % MOD using modular exponentiation
    def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:  # If exp is odd
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp //= 2
        return result

    # If primeFactors is 1, the only possible number is 1
    if primeFactors == 1:
        return 1

    # Divide primeFactors into groups of 3
    quotient, remainder = divmod(primeFactors - 1, 3)

    if remainder == 0:
        return mod_exp(3, quotient, MOD)
    elif remainder == 1:
        return (mod_exp(3, quotient - 1, MOD) * 4) % MOD
    else:  # remainder == 2
        return (mod_exp(3, quotient, MOD) * 2) % MOD

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    primeFactors = 5
    print(maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors))  # Expected Output: 6

    # Test Case 2
    primeFactors = 8
    print(maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors))  # Expected Output: 18

    # Test Case 3
    primeFactors = 1
    print(maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors))  # Expected Output: 1

    # Test Case 4
    primeFactors = 10
    print(maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors))  # Expected Output: 36

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The modular exponentiation function `mod_exp` runs in O(log(exp)) time, where `exp` is the exponent.
- In this problem, `exp` is proportional to `primeFactors`, so the time complexity is O(log(primeFactors)).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
