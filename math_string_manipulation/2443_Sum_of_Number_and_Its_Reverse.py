LeetCode Problem #2443: Sum of Number and Its Reverse

Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer `num`, return `true` if there exists a positive integer `x` such that `x + reverse(x) = num`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here, `reverse(x)` is the integer obtained by reversing the digits of `x`. For example:
- reverse(123) = 321
- reverse(120) = 21

Constraints:
- 1 <= num <= 10^5

    # Explanation: x = 36, reverse(x) = 36, and 36 + 36 = 63.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The function iterates through all integers from 0 to num (inclusive). For each integer x, it computes its reverse, which takes O(d) time where d is the number of digits in x.
- The number of digits in x is at most log10(num), so reversing x takes O(log10(num)) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(num * log10(num)).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(log10(num)) due to the string conversion and reversal operation, which temporarily stores the digits of x.
