LeetCode Problem #274: H-Index

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, 
return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, 
and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Example 1:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- n == citations.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

    # Test Case 5

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sorting the citations array takes O(n log n), where n is the length of the array.
- Iterating through the sorted array takes O(n).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The sorting operation is in-place, so the space complexity is O(1) (ignoring the space used by the sorting algorithm).
