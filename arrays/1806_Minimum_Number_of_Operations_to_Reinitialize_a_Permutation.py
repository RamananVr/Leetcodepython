LeetCode Problem #1806: Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer `n` (even) and a permutation `perm` of size `n` where `perm[i] == i` (0-indexed).

In one operation, you create a new array `newPerm` of size `n` where:
- For every `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`:
  - If `i % 2 == 0`, then `newPerm[i] = perm[i // 2]`.
  - If `i % 2 == 1`, then `newPerm[i] = perm[n // 2 + (i - 1) // 2]`.

You then assign `newPerm` to `perm`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to reinitialize the permutation `perm` to its original state.

Constraints:
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `n` is an even integer.

# Python Solution
def reinitializePermutation(n: int) -> int:
    perm = list(range(n))
    original = list(range(n))
    operations = 0

    while True:
        new_perm = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                new_perm[i] = perm[i // 2]
            else:
                new_perm[i] = perm[n // 2 + (i - 1) // 2]
        perm = new_perm
        operations += 1
        if perm == original:
            break

    return operations

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    n = 2
    print(reinitializePermutation(n))  # Expected Output: 1

    # Test Case 2
    n = 4
    print(reinitializePermutation(n))  # Expected Output: 2

    # Test Case 3
    n = 6
    print(reinitializePermutation(n))  # Expected Output: 4

    # Test Case 4
    n = 8
    print(reinitializePermutation(n))  # Expected Output: 3

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The while loop runs until the permutation returns to its original state. In the worst case, this can take O(n) iterations.
- Inside the loop, we construct a new permutation array, which takes O(n) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

Space Complexity:
- We use a new array `new_perm` of size `n` in each iteration, which takes O(n) space.
- The original permutation and other variables also take O(n) space.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
