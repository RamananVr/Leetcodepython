2729. Check if The Number is Fascinating

You are given an integer n. We call n fascinating if, after the following modification, 
the resulting number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once and does not contain any 0s:

Concatenate n with the numbers 2 * n and 3 * n.

Return true if n is fascinating, or false otherwise.

Concatenating two numbers means joining them together. For example, the concatenation of 121 and 371 is 121371.

Example 1:
Input: n = 192
Output: true
Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 192 and 2 * n = 384 and 3 * n = 576.
The resulting number is 192384576. This number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once, so it is fascinating.

Example 2:
Input: n = 100
Output: false
Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 100 and 2 * n = 200 and 3 * n = 300.
The resulting number is 100200300. This number contains 0s, so it is not fascinating.

Constraints:
- 100 <= n <= 999

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Basic Solution: O(1) - string operations on numbers bounded by 999
- Optimized Solution: O(1) - digit counting with bounded iterations
- Early Exit Solution: O(1) - with early termination for better average case

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Basic Solution: O(1) - using set for constant size input
- Optimized Solution: O(1) - using array of size 10
- Early Exit Solution: O(1) - using set for bounded input

Key Insights:
1. Since n is bounded (100 <= n <= 999), all operations are effectively O(1)
2. String concatenation is simple but digit counting can be more efficient
3. Early exit optimizations help with invalid cases
4. The fascinating property requires exactly 9 digits with no zeros and no repeats
