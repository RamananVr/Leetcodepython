LeetCode Question #422: Valid Word Square

Problem Statement:
Given an array of strings `words`, return true if it forms a valid word square.

A sequence of strings forms a valid word square if the k-th row and k-th column read the same string, 
where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

In other words, the character at position (i, j) in the 2D structure should match the character at position (j, i).

Example 1:
Input: words = ["abcd", "bnrt", "crmy", "dtye"]
Output: true
Explanation:
The 2D grid looks like this:
a b c d
b n r t
c r m y
d t y e
As you can see, the characters match at (i, j) and (j, i).

Example 2:
Input: words = ["abcd", "bnrt", "crm", "dt"]
Output: true
Explanation:
The 2D grid looks like this:
a b c d
b n r t
c r m
d t
As you can see, the characters match at (i, j) and (j, i).

Example 3:
Input: words = ["ball", "area", "read", "lady"]
Output: false
Explanation:
The 2D grid looks like this:
b a l l
a r e a
r e a d
l a d y
The third row and third column do not match.

Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 200
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 200
- words[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Let n be the number of rows in the input `words` and m be the maximum length of a word.
- The outer loop runs for n iterations, and the inner loop runs for up to m iterations.
- In the worst case, we check each character in the grid once, resulting in O(n * m) time complexity.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
