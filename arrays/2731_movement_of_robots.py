2731. Movement of Robots

Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a 0-indexed integer array nums and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second.

You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move:
- 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or the negative side of the number line.
- 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or the positive side of the number line.

When two robots collide, they start moving in opposite directions instantly. A robot moving to the left and a robot moving to the right will collide if they meet at some point and they will instantly reverse directions.

Return the sum of distances between all pairs of robots d seconds after the command.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

The distance between two robots at coordinates x1 and x2 is |x1 - x2|.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,0,2], s = "RLL", d = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 
After 3 seconds, the positions are [-1,-1,1].
The distance between (-1,-1) is |(-1)-(-1)| = 0.
The distance between (-1,1) is |(-1)-1| = 2.
The distance between (-1,1) is |(-1)-1| = 2.
The distance between (-1,1) is |(-1)-1| = 2.
The sum is 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0], s = "RL", d = 2
Output: 5
Explanation:
After 2 seconds, the positions are [3,-2].
The distance between them is |3-(-2)| = 5.

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -2 * 10^9 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^9
- 0 <= d <= 10^9
- s.length == nums.length
- s consists of only 'L' and 'R'.
