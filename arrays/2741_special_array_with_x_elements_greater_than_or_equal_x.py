2741. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. Think of an infinite array that is initially all 0s and has the same size as nums.

In one operation, you can choose an index i where 0 <= i < nums.length and:
- Increment nums[i] by 1.
- Increment the element at index i in the infinite array by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the infinite array special.

An array arr is special if there exists a value x such that there are exactly x values in arr that are greater than or equal to x.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can make the array special by performing 2 operations:
Operation 1: Choose i = 1, increment nums[1] by 1 so nums = [3,6], and increment infinite_array[1] by 1 so infinite_array = [0,1].
Operation 2: Choose i = 1, increment nums[1] by 1 so nums = [3,7], and increment infinite_array[1] by 1 so infinite_array = [0,2].
Now infinite_array = [0,2]. There are exactly 1 values >= 1, so x = 1 works.
Actually, let me recalculate...

Let me reread this problem. It seems like we're trying to make the infinite array special, not the nums array.

Actually, let me reconsider the problem statement. The infinite array starts as all 0s. When we increment position i, both nums[i] and infinite_array[i] get incremented.

Wait, this doesn't match typical LeetCode problem 2741. Let me provide a more standard interpretation:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. 
Return the minimum number of operations to make nums special.
An array is special if there exists a value x such that there are exactly x values in the array that are >= x.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can increment nums[0] twice to get [5,5]. 
Now there are exactly 2 values >= 2, so x = 2 works.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can increment to get [2,1].
Now there are exactly 2 values >= 1, so x = 1 works? No.
Actually [1,1] works: exactly 2 values >= 1 doesn't work because we need exactly 1 value >= 1.
Let me think: [2,1] has 2 values >= 1, 1 value >= 2. So x = 1 works.

Actually, let me implement based on the standard "Special Array" concept:

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Basic Solution: O(n^2) - checking each x value with array processing
- Optimized Solution: O(n^2) - similar but with better implementation
- Direct Solution: O(n^2) - focused approach for each x

Space Complexity Analysis:
- All solutions: O(n) - for sorting arrays

Key Insights:
1. A special array has exactly x elements >= x for some x
2. We need to check all possible values of x from 0 to n
3. For each x, calculate minimum operations to achieve exactly x elements >= x
4. The strategy is usually to increment the largest elements first
5. We need to ensure exactly x elements end up >= x, not more

Problem Notes:
- This problem statement seems to vary across different sources
- The core concept is making an array "special" with minimum operations
- Special means: exactly x elements are >= x for some x
