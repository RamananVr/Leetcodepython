LeetCode Question #2970: Problem Statement

Given the problem number #2970, the exact problem statement is not available in the LeetCode database as of the knowledge cutoff date (October 2023). 
However, I will provide a generic template for solving a problem based on common LeetCode problem types. 
If you have the exact problem statement, please provide it, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

For now, let's assume the problem involves a common algorithmic challenge, such as working with arrays, binary trees, or dynamic programming. 
Below is a structured Python solution template for a hypothetical problem.

"""

# Solution Template
def hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data):
    """
    Solves the hypothetical problem based on the given input data.

    Args:
        input_data (list): A list of integers representing the input data.

    Returns:
        result (int): The result of the computation based on the problem requirements.
    """
    # Example logic: Find the maximum sum of a subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0

    for num in input_data:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

    return max_sum


# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1: Positive numbers
    input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data))  # Expected Output: 15

    # Test Case 2: Mixed positive and negative numbers
    input_data = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
    print(hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data))  # Expected Output: 6

    # Test Case 3: All negative numbers
    input_data = [-1, -2, -3, -4]
    print(hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data))  # Expected Output: -1

    # Test Case 4: Single element
    input_data = [5]
    print(hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data))  # Expected Output: 5

    # Test Case 5: Empty array
    input_data = []
    print(hypothetical_problem_solution(input_data))  # Expected Output: float('-inf') (or handle edge case differently)


# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
The solution iterates through the input array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.
Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

Space Complexity:
The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `max_sum` and `current_sum`.
Thus, the space complexity is O(1).
