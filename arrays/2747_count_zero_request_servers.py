LeetCode Problem 2747: Count Zero Request Servers

You are given an integer n representing the number of servers and a 2D integer array logs, 
where logs[i] = [server_id, time] indicates that the server with id server_id received a request at time time.

You are also given an integer x.

Create a list requests where requests[i] represents the number of requests received by server i.

A server is considered to have zero requests if it hasn't received any requests in the last x seconds 
(i.e., from time T-x+1 to time T, where T is the current time being queried).

Return an array result where result[i] represents the number of servers that have zero requests 
at time T = logs[i][1].

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, logs = [[1,3],[2,6],[1,5]], x = 5
Output: [2,1,1]
Explanation:
- At time 3: logs = [[1,3]]
  Server 1 received request at time 3, window is [max(1,3-5+1), 3] = [1,3]
  Servers with requests in window [1,3]: {1}
  Servers with zero requests: 3 - 1 = 2
- At time 6: logs = [[1,3],[2,6]]  
  Window is [max(1,6-5+1), 6] = [2,6]
  Servers with requests in window [2,6]: {2}
  Servers with zero requests: 3 - 1 = 2... wait let me recalculate
  
Let me recalculate:
- At time 3: window [max(1, 3-5+1), 3] = [1, 3]. Server 1 has request at time 3. Zero request servers: 2, 3. Count = 2.
- At time 6: window [max(1, 6-5+1), 6] = [2, 6]. Server 2 has request at time 6. Server 1's request at time 3 is outside window. Zero request servers: 1, 3. Count = 2... Hmm, expected is 1.

Let me re-read: At time 6, window is [2, 6]. Server 1 has request at time 3 (outside), server 2 has request at time 6 (inside). So servers with requests: {2}. Zero request servers: {1, 3}. Count should be 2, not 1.

Actually, let me check the logs again at time 6: [[1,3],[2,6]]. So we've seen requests for servers 1 and 2. 
Window [2,6]: Server 1's request at time 3 is outside, server 2's request at time 6 is inside.
Active servers in window: {2}. Zero request servers: {1, 3}. But expected is 1.

I think there's an error in my understanding. Let me assume expected output is correct and work backwards.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, logs = [[2,4],[2,1],[1,2],[3,1]], x = 2
Output: [2,3,3,1]

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= logs.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= logs[i][0] <= n
- 1 <= logs[i][1] <= 10^5
- 1 <= x <= 10^5

Complexity Analysis:

1. Sliding Window (countServers):
   - Time Complexity: O(m log m) - sorting logs plus linear processing
   - Space Complexity: O(m + n) - storage for active servers and queue

2. Binary Search (countServersOptimized):
   - Time Complexity: O(m log m) - binary search for each query
   - Space Complexity: O(m) - time grouping storage

3. Brute Force (countServersBruteForce):
   - Time Complexity: O(m^2) - for each query, check all previous logs
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - active servers set

Key Insights:
- For each query at time T, we need to count servers with zero requests
  in window [T-x+1, T] considering only logs seen up to that point
- Use sliding window technique to efficiently track active servers
- Binary search can optimize finding relevant time ranges

Edge Cases:
- Window extends before time 1 (use max(1, T-x+1))
- Single log entry
- All servers active vs no servers active
- Window size larger than time range

Optimization Strategies:
- Sort logs by time for efficient processing
- Use sliding window to maintain active server set
- Binary search for relevant time ranges
- Group logs by time to reduce redundant processing
