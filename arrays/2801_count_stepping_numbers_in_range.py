LeetCode Problem 2801: Count Stepping Numbers in Range

Given two positive integers low and high, find the count of stepping numbers in the range [low, high] inclusive.

A stepping number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1.
For example, 321 is a stepping number while 421 is not.

Constraints:
- 1 <= low <= high <= 2 * 10^15

Example 1:
Input: low = "1", high = "11"
Output: 10
Explanation: The stepping numbers in the range [1,11] are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. There are a total of 10 stepping numbers.

Example 2:
Input: low = "90", high = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: The stepping numbers in the range [90,101] are 98 and 101. There are a total of 2 stepping numbers.

Topics: Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Math
Difficulty: Hard

Key Insights:
1. Use digit DP to efficiently count numbers with constraints
2. BFS can generate all stepping numbers level by level
3. DFS with pruning can be more memory efficient
4. Handle leading zeros carefully in digit DP
5. Single digit numbers (1-9) are all stepping numbers
