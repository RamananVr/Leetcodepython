    Placeholder function to solve LeetCode Problem #2890.
    Replace the logic below with the actual solution once the problem statement is known.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The input array.

    Returns:
    Any: The result based on the problem requirements.

    # Example operation: Return the sum of the array
    return sum(nums)

    nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print(solve_problem(nums1))  # Expected Output: 15 (if the operation is summing the array)

    # Test Case 2
    nums2 = [10, -2, 3, 0]
    print(solve_problem(nums2))  # Expected Output: 11 (if the operation is summing the array)

    # Test Case 3
    nums3 = []
    print(solve_problem(nums3))  # Expected Output: 0 (if the operation is summing the array)

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity:
- If the operation is summing the array, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) since no additional data structures are used.
