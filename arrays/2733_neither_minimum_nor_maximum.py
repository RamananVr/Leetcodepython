2733. Neither Minimum nor Maximum

Given an integer array nums containing distinct positive integers, find and return any number from the array that is neither the minimum nor the maximum value in the array, or -1 if there is no such number.

Return the selected number.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the minimum value is 1 and the maximum value is 4. Therefore, either 2 or 3 can be valid answers.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number in nums that is neither the maximum nor the minimum, we cannot select a number that satisfies the given condition. Therefore, we return -1.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Since 2 is neither the minimum (1) nor the maximum (3), it is a valid answer.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
- All values in nums are distinct.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Basic Solution: O(n) - two passes (min/max + search)
- One Pass: O(n) - single pass to find min/max, then another to find middle
- Optimized: O(n) - similar to basic but with some optimizations for small cases
- Three Elements: O(1) - only examines first 3 elements

Space Complexity Analysis:
- All solutions: O(1) - using constant extra space

Key Insights:
1. For arrays with length <= 2, no valid answer exists
2. For arrays with length >= 3, there's always at least one valid answer
3. We can optimize by only checking the first few elements in some cases
4. The problem allows returning any valid answer, not a specific one
5. Since all values are distinct, we don't need to handle duplicates
