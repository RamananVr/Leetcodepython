LeetCode Question #1508: Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums

Problem Statement:
You are given the array nums consisting of n positive integers and an integer n. 
You need to calculate the sum of the numbers obtained by summing all possible 
subarrays of nums and then sorting the sums in non-decreasing order. 
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (inclusive) in the sorted list of sums.

Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
- 1 <= left <= right <= n * (n + 1) / 2
"""

# Python Solution
from itertools import accumulate

def rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    subarray_sums = []
    
    # Generate all subarray sums
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for sum_value in accumulate(nums[i:]):
            subarray_sums.append(sum_value)
    
    # Sort the subarray sums
    subarray_sums.sort()
    
    # Calculate the sum of the range [left, right]
    return sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right]) % MOD

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    n = 4
    left = 1
    right = 5
    print(rangeSum(nums, n, left, right))  # Expected Output: 13

    # Test Case 2
    nums = [1, 2, 3]
    n = 3
    left = 4
    right = 6
    print(rangeSum(nums, n, left, right))  # Expected Output: 6

    # Test Case 3
    nums = [5, 2, 1]
    n = 3
    left = 1
    right = 3
    print(rangeSum(nums, n, left, right))  # Expected Output: 8

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- Generating all subarray sums: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
  This is because for each starting index, we calculate the sum of all subarrays starting at that index.
- Sorting the subarray sums: O(m log m), where m = n * (n + 1) / 2 (the total number of subarrays).
- Summing the range [left, right]: O(right - left).

Overall time complexity: O(n^2 + m log m), where m = n * (n + 1) / 2.

Space Complexity:
- Storing all subarray sums: O(m), where m = n * (n + 1) / 2.
- Additional space for sorting: O(m).

Overall space complexity: O(m).
