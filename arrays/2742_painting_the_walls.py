LeetCode Problem 2742: Painting the Walls

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, cost and time, of size n representing n different walls. 
The ith wall takes time[i] units of time to paint and costs cost[i] units of money to paint.

You have two painters available:
- A paid painter that will paint the ith wall in time[i] units of time and will cost you cost[i] units of money.
- A free painter that will paint any wall in 1 unit of time at no cost. However, the free painter can only be used 
  if the paid painter is currently painting a wall.

Return the minimum amount of money required to paint n walls.

Example 1:
Input: cost = [1,2,3,2], time = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The walls are painted as follows:
- Paint wall 0 using paid painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 1 unit of money.
- Paint wall 1 using free painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 0 units of money.
- Paint wall 2 using paid painter, taking 3 units of time, costing 3 units of money.
- Paint wall 3 using free painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 0 units of money.
The total time is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 units of time.
The total cost is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 4 units of money.
However, you can paint the walls in less time for less money:
- Paint wall 0 using paid painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 1 unit of money.
- Paint wall 2 using paid painter, taking 3 units of time, costing 3 units of money.
- Paint wall 1 using free painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 0 units of money.
- Paint wall 3 using free painter, taking 1 unit of time, costing 0 units of money.
The total time is 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6 units of time.
The total cost is 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 units of money.
Actually, you can do better:
- Paint wall 1 using paid painter, taking 2 units of time, costing 2 units of money.
- Paint wall 2 using paid painter, taking 3 units of time, costing 3 units of money.
- Paint walls 0 and 3 using free painter while paid painter works, costing 0 units of money.
The total cost is 2 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 5 units of money.
Wait, let me recalculate:
- Paint wall 0 using paid painter, costing 1, time 1. Free painter can paint 1 wall.
- Paint wall 1 using paid painter, costing 2, time 2. Free painter can paint 2 walls.
So we can paint all 4 walls for cost 1 + 2 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: cost = [2,3,4,2], time = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Paint walls 0 and 3 using paid painter for a total cost of 2 + 2 = 4. 
Free painter paints walls 1 and 2.

Constraints:
- 1 <= cost.length <= 500
- cost.length == time.length
- 1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6
- 1 <= time[i] <= 500

Complexity Analysis:

1. Top-down DP (paintWalls):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - we have n*n states (i, remain)
   - Space Complexity: O(n^2) - memoization table + recursion stack

2. Bottom-up DP (paintWallsBottomUp):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) - nested loops over walls and remaining count
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - DP array of size n+1

3. Greedy (paintWallsGreedy):
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) - sorting step
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - for storing wall tuples

Key Insights:
- This is essentially a variant of the knapsack problem
- We need to select walls for paid painter such that total time >= n-1
- The free painter can paint time[i] walls while paid painter works on wall i
- Dynamic programming gives optimal solution
- Greedy approach may not always give optimal result but can be good approximation
