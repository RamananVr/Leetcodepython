LeetCode Problem #2059: Minimum Operations to Convert Number

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer `start` and a list of integers `nums`. You can perform the following operations on `start`:
1. Add any number from `nums` to `start`.
2. Subtract any number from `nums` from `start`.
3. XOR any number from `nums` with `start`.

Your goal is to convert `start` into `goal` using the minimum number of operations. Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert `start` into `goal`. If it is impossible, return -1.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= start, goal <= 10^9`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- In the worst case, we explore all possible states within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
- For each state, we generate up to 3 * len(nums) new states (add, subtract, XOR).
- However, the visited set ensures we do not revisit states, significantly reducing the number of states explored.
- The exact complexity depends on the range of reachable states, but it is bounded by O(3 * len(nums) * reachable_states).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the `visited` set and the `queue`.
- The `visited` set can grow up to the number of reachable states, and the `queue` can hold up to the same number of states.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(reachable_states).
