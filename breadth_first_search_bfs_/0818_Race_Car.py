LeetCode Problem #818: Race Car

Problem Statement:
Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. 
Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):

- 'A': Instructs your car to accelerate by increasing its speed by 1 unit and moving forward by the speed.
- 'R': Instructs your car to reverse its direction. After reversing, your speed changes to -1 * current_speed.

For example, after executing the instructions "AAR", your car goes to positions 1, 3, and 2 respectively.

Given a target position `target`, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to reach the target position.

Constraints:
- 1 <= target <= 10^4

"""
Time Complexity:
- The BFS explores all possible states (position, speed) until the target is reached.
- The number of states is bounded by O(target * log(target)) because the speed doubles or halves, and the position is limited to 2 * target.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(target * log(target)).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the size of the queue and the visited set, which is also O(target * log(target)).
