LeetCode Problem #2612: Minimum Reverse Operations

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer `n`, an integer `p`, an array `banned` of integers, and an integer `k`.

You are tasked to perform operations on an array `arr` of size `n` initialized with integers from `0` to `n-1` in increasing order. The operations are defined as follows:
1. Choose an index `i` in the array `arr`.
2. Reverse the subarray starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + k - 1` (inclusive). If `i + k - 1` exceeds the bounds of the array, the operation is invalid.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the element at index `p` to index `0`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= p < n`
- `0 <= banned.length <= n`
- `0 <= banned[i] < n`
- `1 <= k <= n`
- All elements in `banned` are unique.

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The BFS traversal ensures that we visit each index at most once. Since the array has `n` elements, the time complexity is O(n).
- Additionally, calculating the possible reverse operations involves constant time operations, so the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the `visited` set and the BFS queue, both of which can grow up to size `n`. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
