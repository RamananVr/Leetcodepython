LeetCode Problem #1713: Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence

Problem Statement:
You are given two arrays `target` and `arr`, both of which consist of unique integers. You can perform the following operation on `arr` any number of times:

- Insert any integer at any position in `arr`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.

A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Constraints:
- `1 <= target.length, arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= target[i], arr[i] <= 10^9`
- All the integers in `target` are unique.
- All the integers in `arr` are unique.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- Mapping `target` to indices: O(n), where n is the length of `target`.
- Filtering `arr` and mapping to indices: O(m), where m is the length of `arr`.
- Finding the LIS using binary search: O(k * log(k)), where k is the length of `filtered_arr`.
  In the worst case, k = min(n, m).
- Overall: O(n + m + k * log(k)) â‰ˆ O(n + m + min(n, m) * log(min(n, m))).

Space Complexity:
- Space for `target_index`: O(n).
- Space for `filtered_arr`: O(min(n, m)).
- Space for `lis`: O(min(n, m)).
- Overall: O(n + min(n, m)).
