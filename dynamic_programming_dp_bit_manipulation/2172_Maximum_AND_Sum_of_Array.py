LeetCode Problem #2172: Maximum AND Sum of Array

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `numSlots` such that `2 * numSlots >= n`. 
There are `numSlots` slots numbered from 1 to `numSlots`. Each slot can hold at most two elements. 
The AND sum of a given placement is the sum of the bitwise AND of each number with the slot number it is placed in.

- For example, if the array is `nums = [1, 3, 10]` and the placement is `[1, 3]` in slot 1 and `[10]` in slot 2, 
  the AND sum is `(1 & 1) + (3 & 1) + (10 & 2)`.

Return the maximum possible AND sum of `nums` given the conditions.

Constraints:
1. `n == nums.length`
2. `1 <= n <= 15`
3. `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
4. `1 <= numSlots <= 9`

    print("Test Case 3 Output:", maximumANDSum(nums3, numSlots3))  # Expected Output: 16

"""
Time Complexity:
- The number of states in the DFS is bounded by O(2^n * numSlots^2), where `n` is the length of `nums` and `numSlots` is the number of slots.
- For each state, we perform O(numSlots) work.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(2^n * numSlots^3).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(2^n * numSlots^2) due to the memoization table and the recursion stack.
