LeetCode Problem #2422: Merge Operations

Problem Statement:
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Choose two adjacent elements in the array, and replace them with their sum.

The goal is to make the array a palindrome. A palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array a palindrome.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach to traverse the array from both ends.
- In each iteration, either the left pointer moves forward or the right pointer moves backward.
- Therefore, the algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm modifies the input array in place and does not use any additional data structures.
- Thus, the space complexity is O(1).
