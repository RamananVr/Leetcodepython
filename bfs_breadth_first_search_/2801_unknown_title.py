LeetCode Problem #2801: Count Stepping Numbers in Range

Problem Statement:
A "stepping number" is an integer such that all adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1. 
For example, 123 is a stepping number because |1 - 2| = 1 and |2 - 3| = 1, but 358 is not a stepping number 
because |3 - 5| â‰  1.

Given two integers low and high, return the count of all stepping numbers in the inclusive range [low, high].

Constraints:
- 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

Example:
Input: low = 0, high = 21
Output: 13
Explanation: The stepping numbers in the range are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21].

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The BFS approach ensures that we only generate valid stepping numbers within the range [low, high].
- The number of stepping numbers is limited by the range and the constraints of the problem.
- In the worst case, we generate all stepping numbers up to 10^9, but this is highly constrained by the range.
- The complexity is approximately O(N), where N is the number of stepping numbers generated.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the size of the queue used in BFS.
- In the worst case, the queue can hold all stepping numbers up to the range [low, high].
- The space complexity is approximately O(N), where N is the number of stepping numbers generated.
