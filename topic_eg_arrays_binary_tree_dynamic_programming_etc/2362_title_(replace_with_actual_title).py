It seems the problem statement provided is incomplete and does not describe the actual problem. However, based on the mention of "LeetCode Question #2362," I can infer that the problem might be related to a specific LeetCode problem. Unfortunately, without the exact problem description, I cannot provide a precise solution.

If you can provide the full problem description, I will be happy to assist with a clean Python solution, test cases, and analysis.

For now, I'll provide a template for how the solution file should look, based on your requirements:
