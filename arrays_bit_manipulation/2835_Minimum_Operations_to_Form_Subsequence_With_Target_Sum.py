LeetCode Problem #2835: Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum

Problem Statement:
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers and an integer `target`.

In one operation, you can choose any positive integer `x` and append it to `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `nums`. If it is impossible to form `target`, return -1.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i], target <= 10^9
"""

# Python Solution
from collections import Counter

def minOperations(nums, target):
    # Check if the sum of nums is less than target; if so, it's impossible
    if sum(nums) < target:
        return -1

    # Count the frequency of powers of 2 in nums
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Initialize variables
    operations = 0
    current_sum = 0
    power = 1  # Start with 2^0 = 1
    
    while power <= target:
        # If the current bit is set in target, try to fulfill it
        if target & power:
            if freq[power] > 0:
                current_sum += power
                freq[power] -= 1
            else:
                # If the current power is not available, we need to add it
                operations += 1
                current_sum += power
        
        # If the current sum exceeds target, break early
        if current_sum >= target:
            break
        
        # Move to the next power of 2
        power *= 2
    
    return operations if current_sum >= target else -1

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    nums1 = [1, 2, 8]
    target1 = 7
    print(minOperations(nums1, target1))  # Expected Output: 1

    # Test Case 2
    nums2 = [1, 32, 1, 2]
    target2 = 35
    print(minOperations(nums2, target2))  # Expected Output: 2

    # Test Case 3
    nums3 = [1, 1, 1, 1]
    target3 = 10
    print(minOperations(nums3, target3))  # Expected Output: -1

    # Test Case 4
    nums4 = [16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
    target4 = 15
    print(minOperations(nums4, target4))  # Expected Output: 0

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through powers of 2 up to the value of `target`. Since the maximum value of `target` is 10^9, the number of iterations is approximately log2(10^9) â‰ˆ 30.
- Counting the frequency of elements in `nums` takes O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n + log(target)).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the `Counter` to store frequencies of elements in `nums`.
