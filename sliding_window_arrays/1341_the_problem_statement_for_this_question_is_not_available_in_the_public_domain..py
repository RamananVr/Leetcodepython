# Hypothetical Problem Statement:
"""
Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

Write a function `maxSubarraySum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int` that returns the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= len(nums)
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20], k = 4
Output: 39
Explanation: The subarray [4, 2, 10, 23] has the maximum sum of 39.

# Python Solution

    """
    Finds the maximum sum of any subarray of size k using the sliding window technique.

    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        # Update the window sum by adding the next element and removing the first element of the previous window
        window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        # Update the maximum sum
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    k5 = 5

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing O(1) operations for each element.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (no additional data structures are used).
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
