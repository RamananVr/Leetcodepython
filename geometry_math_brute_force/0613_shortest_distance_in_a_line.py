LeetCode Question #613: Shortest Distance in a Line

Problem Statement:
Given a table `Point` that contains two columns: `x` (the x-coordinate of a point) and `y` (the y-coordinate of a point), 
write a SQL query to find the shortest distance between any two points in the table. 
The result should be a single number rounded to 2 decimal places.

Note:
- The table may contain duplicate points.
- The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated as:
  distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).

Example:
Input:
Point table:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| 0  | 0  |
| 1  | 1  |
| 2  | 2  |
| 0  | 1  |
+----+----+

Output:
1.00

# Python Solution:
# Since this is a SQL-based problem, we will simulate the solution in Python using a list of tuples to represent the table.

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity:
# - The function uses a nested loop to compare every pair of points.
# - If there are `n` points, the number of comparisons is C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2.
# - Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

# Space Complexity:
# - The function uses a constant amount of extra space (apart from the input list).
# - Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
