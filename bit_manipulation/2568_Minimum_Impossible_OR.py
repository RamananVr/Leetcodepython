LeetCode Problem #2568: Minimum Impossible OR

Problem Statement:
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You need to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as the bitwise OR of some subset of `nums`.

A subset of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements from `nums`. The bitwise OR of an empty subset is defined as 0.

Return the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as the bitwise OR of some subset of `nums`.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- The function iterates through powers of 2 until it finds one not in the set.
- The number of iterations is proportional to the number of bits in the largest number in `nums`.
- Since nums[i] <= 10^9, the maximum number of bits is approximately 30 (log2(10^9)).
- Checking membership in a set is O(1), so the overall time complexity is O(log(max(nums))).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, due to the set used to store the elements of `nums`.
