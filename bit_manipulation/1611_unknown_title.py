LeetCode Problem #1611: Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, you must perform operations to make the integer zero. In one operation, you can:
- Choose any bit in the binary representation of `n` and flip it (change it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
- However, you cannot flip the same bit twice in a row.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `n` equal to zero.

Constraints:
- 0 <= n <= 10^9

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The function uses recursion to calculate the minimum operations. The number of recursive calls is proportional to the number of bits in `n`.
- The bit_length() function runs in O(log n) time, and the recursive calls also depend on the number of bits in `n`.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(log n).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack, which is proportional to the number of bits in `n`.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(log n).
