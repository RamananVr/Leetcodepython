LeetCode Problem #405: Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Problem Statement:
Given an integer `num`, return its hexadecimal representation as a string. 
For negative integers, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

All the letters in the hexadecimal representation (a-f) must be lowercase.

The hexadecimal representation should not include extra leading `0s`. 
If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, 
the first character in the hexadecimal representation will not be the zero character.

Constraints:
- -2^31 <= num <= 2^31 - 1
- You must not use any built-in library to directly perform the conversion.

Example 1:
Input: num = 26
Output: "1a"

Example 2:
Input: num = -1
Output: "ffffffff"

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The while loop runs until `num` becomes 0. In the worst case, for a 32-bit integer, the loop runs at most 8 times 
  (since each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits, and 32 bits / 4 = 8 digits).
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(1), as the number of iterations is constant and does not depend on the input size.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) for the variables used in the function.
- However, the `result` list stores the hexadecimal digits, which can have at most 8 characters for a 32-bit integer.
- Thus, the space complexity is O(1) as well, since the size of the result list is bounded by a constant.
