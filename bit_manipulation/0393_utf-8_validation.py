LeetCode Question #393: UTF-8 Validation

Problem Statement:
A character in UTF-8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
1. For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its 7-bit data.
2. For a 2-byte character, the first two bits are 10, followed by its 6-bit data.
3. For a 3-byte character, the first three bits are 110, followed by its 5-bit data.
4. For a 4-byte character, the first four bits are 1110, followed by its 4-bit data.

The data is given in an integer array `data` where each integer represents one byte of data. Return `true` if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return `false`.

Note:
- The integer values in the array are between 0 and 255, inclusive.
- The UTF-8 encoding rules specify that the continuation bytes (for multi-byte characters) must start with the bits `10`.

Example 1:
Input: data = [197, 130, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The data represents the valid UTF-8 encoding for the characters 'Ã‡' and 'A'.

Example 2:
Input: data = [235, 140, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: The data is invalid because the continuation byte does not start with '10'.

Constraints:
- 1 <= data.length <= 2 * 10^4
- 0 <= data[i] <= 255

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
1. Time Complexity:
   - The function iterates through the `data` array once, processing each byte.
   - For each leading byte, it checks the continuation bytes (up to 3 additional bytes).
   - Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `data` array.

2. Space Complexity:
   - The function uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and bitwise operations.
   - Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
