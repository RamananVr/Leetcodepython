LeetCode Problem #1238: Circular Permutation in Binary Representation

Problem Statement:
Given 2 integers `n` and `start`, return any permutation `p` of `(0, 1, 2, ..., 2^n - 1)` such that:
1. `p` is a circular permutation in binary representation.
2. Specifically, the first element of `p` is `start`.
3. The binary representation of consecutive elements in `p` differs by exactly one bit.
4. The binary representation of the last element in `p` differs by exactly one bit from the first element.

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 16`
- `0 <= start < 2^n`

    Generate a circular permutation in binary representation starting with `start`.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

1. Time Complexity:
   - Generating the Gray code sequence takes O(2^n) since we iterate over all integers from 0 to 2^n - 1.
   - Finding the index of `start` in the Gray code sequence takes O(2^n) in the worst case.
   - Rearranging the sequence takes O(2^n).
   - Overall time complexity: O(2^n).

2. Space Complexity:
   - The Gray code sequence is stored in a list of size 2^n.
   - Overall space complexity: O(2^n).
