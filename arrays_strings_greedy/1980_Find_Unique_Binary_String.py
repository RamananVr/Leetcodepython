LeetCode Problem #1980: Find Unique Binary String

Problem Statement:
Given an array of strings `nums` where each string is of the same length `n` and consists of only '0's and '1's, 
return a binary string of length `n` that is not present in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = ["01", "10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" is not in nums. "00" is also not in nums, but "11" is returned.

Example 2:
Input: nums = ["00", "01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" is not in nums. "10" is also not in nums, but "11" is returned.

Example 3:
Input: nums = ["111", "011", "001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" is not in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" are also not in nums, but "101" is returned.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 16
- 1 <= nums[i].length <= 16
- nums[i] consists of only '0's and '1's.

# Clean and Correct Python Solution
def findDifferentBinaryString(nums):
    """
    This function finds a binary string of length n that is not present in the input list nums.
    It uses the diagonalization method to ensure the result is unique.
    """
    n = len(nums)
    # Construct the binary string by flipping the i-th bit of the i-th string in nums
    result = ''.join('1' if nums[i][i] == '0' else '0' for i in range(n))
    return result

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    nums1 = ["01", "10"]
    print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums1))  # Output: "11" (or any other valid answer)

    # Test Case 2
    nums2 = ["00", "01"]
    print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums2))  # Output: "11" (or any other valid answer)

    # Test Case 3
    nums3 = ["111", "011", "001"]
    print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums3))  # Output: "101" (or any other valid answer)

    # Test Case 4
    nums4 = ["0"]
    print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums4))  # Output: "1"

    # Test Case 5
    nums5 = ["1111", "0111", "0011", "0001"]
    print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums5))  # Output: "1000" (or any other valid answer)

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The solution iterates through the input list `nums` once to construct the result string.
- Since the length of `nums` is `n` and each string in `nums` is also of length `n`, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The solution constructs a single binary string of length `n`, which requires O(n) space.
- No additional data structures are used, so the overall space complexity is O(n).
