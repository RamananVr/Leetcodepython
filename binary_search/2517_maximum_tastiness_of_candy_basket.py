LeetCode Question #2517: Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of positive integers `price` where `price[i]` represents the price of the ith candy. 
You are also given a positive integer `k`.

The tastiness of a candy basket is defined as the minimum absolute difference of the prices of any two candies 
in the basket. You want to select `k` candies such that the tastiness of the basket is maximized.

Return the maximum tastiness of the candy basket.

Example 1:
Input: price = [13, 5, 1, 8, 21], k = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose candies with prices [13, 5, 21]. The tastiness of the basket is min(|13 - 5|, |13 - 21|, |5 - 21|) = 8.

Example 2:
Input: price = [1, 3, 1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Choose candies with prices [1, 3]. The tastiness of the basket is min(|1 - 3|) = 2.

Example 3:
Input: price = [7, 7, 7, 7], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose candies with prices [7, 7]. The tastiness of the basket is min(|7 - 7|) = 0.

Constraints:
- 2 <= k <= price.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= price[i] <= 10^9

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n), where n is the length of the `price` array.
- Binary search runs for O(log(max_diff)), where max_diff is the difference between the largest and smallest price.
- For each binary search iteration, we iterate through the array to check if a basket can be formed, which takes O(n).
- Overall complexity: O(n log n + n log(max_diff)) â‰ˆ O(n log n).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures apart from variables.
