LeetCode Problem #2371: Minimize Maximum Value in a Grid

Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D grid of integers `grid` of size `m x n`. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:
- Choose any cell `(i, j)` in the grid and increment its value by 1.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum value in the grid after performing any number of operations.

Return the minimum possible maximum value in the grid.

Constraints:
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^9`
"""

# Solution
def minimizeMaxValue(grid):
    def isPossible(mid):
        # Check if we can make all values in the grid <= mid
        total_operations = 0
        for row in grid:
            for value in row:
                if value > mid:
                    total_operations += value - mid
        return total_operations <= 0

    # Binary search for the minimum possible maximum value
    left, right = max(max(row) for row in grid), sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if isPossible(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    grid1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    print(minimizeMaxValue(grid1))  # Expected Output: 4

    # Test Case 2
    grid2 = [[10, 20], [30, 40]]
    print(minimizeMaxValue(grid2))  # Expected Output: 40

    # Test Case 3
    grid3 = [[5, 5], [5, 5]]
    print(minimizeMaxValue(grid3))  # Expected Output: 5

    # Test Case 4
    grid4 = [[1]]
    print(minimizeMaxValue(grid4))  # Expected Output: 1

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Let `m` and `n` be the dimensions of the grid.
- The binary search runs in O(log(max_value - min_value)).
- For each binary search step, we iterate over all `m * n` elements in the grid.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O((m * n) * log(max_value - min_value)).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures.
