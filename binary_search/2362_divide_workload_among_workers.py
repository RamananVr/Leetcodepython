LeetCode Question #2362: Divide Workload Among Workers

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` represents the time required to complete the i-th task. 
You are also given an integer `k` representing the number of workers available. 
Your goal is to divide the tasks among the workers such that the maximum workload assigned to any worker is minimized.

Return the minimized maximum workload.

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(tasks) <= 10^4
- 1 <= tasks[i] <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= len(tasks)

# 3. Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    tasks = [10, 20, 30, 40]
    k = 2
    print(minimized_maximum_workload(tasks, k))  # Expected Output: 60

    # Test Case 2
    tasks = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    k = 3
    print(minimized_maximum_workload(tasks, k))  # Expected Output: 10

    # Test Case 3
    tasks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    k = 2
    print(minimized_maximum_workload(tasks, k))  # Expected Output: 9

    # Test Case 4
    tasks = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8]
    k = 2
    print(minimized_maximum_workload(tasks, k))  # Expected Output: 18

# 4. Time And Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The binary search runs in O(log(sum(tasks) - max(tasks))).
- The `can_distribute` function iterates through the tasks array, which takes O(len(tasks)).
- Overall complexity: O(len(tasks) * log(sum(tasks) - max(tasks))).

Space Complexity:
- The solution uses O(1) additional space, as no extra data structures are used.
- Overall complexity: O(1).
