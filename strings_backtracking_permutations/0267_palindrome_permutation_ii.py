LeetCode Question #267: Palindrome Permutation II

Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`, return all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it. 
Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be formed.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. A permutation of a string is a rearrangement of its characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: ["abba", "baab"]

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: []

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 16
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.

Time Complexity Analysis:
1. Counting character frequencies: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
2. Generating permutations of the half string: O((n/2)!), where n/2 is the length of the half string.
3. Constructing palindromes: O((n/2)!) since we iterate over all permutations.

Overall Time Complexity: O(n + (n/2)!) â‰ˆ O((n/2)!) for large n.

Space Complexity Analysis:
1. Space for the character count dictionary: O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in `s`.
2. Space for storing permutations: O((n/2)!) for the set of permutations.
3. Space for the result list: O((n/2)!) for storing palindromes.

Overall Space Complexity: O((n/2)!) for large n.
