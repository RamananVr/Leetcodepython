LeetCode Problem #51: N-Queens

Problem Statement:
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 9

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity of the N-Queens problem is O(N!), where N is the size of the board. This is because there are N choices for the first row, N-1 choices for the second row, N-2 for the third, and so on, leading to N! permutations in the worst case.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is O(N^2) for the board representation and O(N) for the sets used to track columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals. Thus, the overall space complexity is O(N^2).
