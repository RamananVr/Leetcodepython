LeetCode Question #52: N-Queens II

Problem Statement:
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below:
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 9

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(N!), where N is the size of the board. This is because for the first row, we have N choices, for the second row, we have N-1 choices, and so on.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion stack and the sets used to track columns and diagonals.
