LeetCode Problem #489: Robot Room Cleaner

Problem Statement:
You are controlling a robot that is located in a room with obstacles. The room is modeled as an m x n grid, where each cell is either empty (0) or an obstacle (1). The robot starts at an arbitrary position and faces an arbitrary direction (north, east, south, or west). The robot has the following functions:

1. `move()`: Moves the robot one step forward in its current direction. If the cell in front of the robot is an obstacle, the robot stays in place and returns `False`. Otherwise, it moves forward and returns `True`.
2. `turnLeft()`: Rotates the robot 90 degrees counterclockwise.
3. `turnRight()`: Rotates the robot 90 degrees clockwise.
4. `clean()`: Cleans the current cell.

The robot is guaranteed to be in an empty cell initially, and the entire room is connected (i.e., all empty cells are reachable from the starting position).

You need to design an algorithm to clean the entire room using the robot's functions.

Constraints:
- The input is provided indirectly via the robot's control interface.
- The robot's initial position and direction are arbitrary.
- The room is bounded, but its dimensions are unknown.
- The robot cannot access the room's grid directly.

# Example Test Cases
"""
Note: Since the problem involves a robot interface, we cannot directly test it without a simulation environment.
However, the logic can be tested in a mock environment where the robot's behavior is simulated.
"""

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The robot visits each cell once and performs a constant amount of work per cell (cleaning, moving, turning).
- If there are N empty cells, the time complexity is O(N).

Space Complexity:
- The visited set stores all visited cells, which requires O(N) space, where N is the number of empty cells.
- The recursion stack can go as deep as the number of empty cells in the worst case, so the space complexity is O(N).

Overall: Time Complexity = O(N), Space Complexity = O(N)
