LeetCode Question #1678: Goal Parser Interpretation

Problem Statement:
You are given a string `command`, which represents the instructions of a goal parser. The goal parser interprets the string `command` as follows:
- `"G"` -> `"G"`
- `"()"` -> `"o"`
- `"(al)"` -> `"al"`

The interpreted string is formed by concatenating the results of the interpretation of each portion of the `command`.

Given the string `command`, return the interpreted string.

Example 1:
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
Explanation: The goal parser interprets the command as follows:
- "G" -> "G"
- "()" -> "o"
- "(al)" -> "al"
Hence, the final result is "Goal".

Example 2:
Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"
Output: "Gooooal"

Example 3:
Input: command = "(al)G(al)()()G"
Output: "alGalooG"

Constraints:
- `1 <= command.length <= 100`
- `command` consists of `"G"`, `"()"`, and `"(al)"` in some order.

# Clean, Correct Python Solution
def interpret(command: str) -> str:
    """
    Interprets the given command string based on the goal parser rules.

    Args:
    command (str): The input command string.

    Returns:
    str: The interpreted string.
    """
    return command.replace("()", "o").replace("(al)", "al")

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    command1 = "G()(al)"
    print(interpret(command1))  # Output: "Goal"

    # Test Case 2
    command2 = "G()()()()(al)"
    print(interpret(command2))  # Output: "Gooooal"

    # Test Case 3
    command3 = "(al)G(al)()()G"
    print(interpret(command3))  # Output: "alGalooG"

    # Test Case 4
    command4 = "G"
    print(interpret(command4))  # Output: "G"

    # Test Case 5
    command5 = "()"
    print(interpret(command5))  # Output: "o"

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The `replace` method is called twice on the input string. Each call to `replace` has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The `replace` method creates a new string each time it is called, but no additional data structures are used.
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, due to the creation of the new string.

Overall:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
