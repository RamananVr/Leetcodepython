LeetCode Problem #2682: Find the Losers of the Circular Game

Problem Statement:
There are n friends playing a circular game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. 
Each friend holds a pass initially. The rules of the game are as follows:
1. Starting with the friend numbered 1, they pass the ball to the next friend in the clockwise direction.
2. After k passes, the friend holding the ball is eliminated from the game.
3. The game continues until only one friend remains.

Given the integer n and the integer k, return a list of the friends who are eliminated in the order they are eliminated.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= k <= n

# Python Solution
def circularGameLosers(n: int, k: int) -> list:
    eliminated = []
    friends = list(range(1, n + 1))
    current =0
