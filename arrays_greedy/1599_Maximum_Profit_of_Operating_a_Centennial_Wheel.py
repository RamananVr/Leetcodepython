LeetCode Problem #1599: Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel

Problem Statement:
You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola can carry up to four people. 
You have the ability to rotate the wheel counterclockwise, which costs you `runningCost` dollars per rotation. 
You are given an array `customers` where `customers[i]` is the number of customers that arrive at the wheel at the i-th rotation. 
You can only serve up to 4 customers per rotation, and any remaining customers wait for the next rotation.

You are tasked with finding the minimum number of rotations needed to achieve the maximum profit. 
If there is no profit, return -1.

The profit after each rotation is calculated as:
    Profit = (Total customers served * boardingCost) - (Total rotations * runningCost)

Return the minimum number of rotations needed to achieve the maximum profit. If the profit is never positive, return -1.

Constraints:
- `1 <= customers.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= customers[i] <= 50`
- `1 <= boardingCost, runningCost <= 100`

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- O(n), where n is the length of the `customers` array. We iterate through the array once and then process any remaining customers in a while loop. 
  Since the number of remaining customers is bounded by the total number of customers, the overall complexity is linear.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables like `waiting_customers`, `current_profit`, etc.
