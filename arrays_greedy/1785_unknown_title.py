LeetCode Problem #1785: Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array `nums` contains elements 
in the range `[-limit, limit]`. You are tasked to determine the minimum number of elements we need to add to 
`nums` (these elements can be any integer between `-limit` and `limit`, inclusive) such that the sum of the 
resulting array equals `goal`.

Return the minimum number of elements required.

Constraints:
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
2. 1 <= limit <= 10^6
3. -10^9 <= goal <= 10^9
4. -limit <= nums[i] <= limit
"""

# Solution
def minElements(nums, limit, goal):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of elements to add to nums to make its sum equal to goal.

    :param nums: List[int] - The input array
    :param limit: int - The maximum absolute value of elements that can be added
    :param goal: int - The target sum
    :return: int - The minimum number of elements required

    # Calculate the current sum of the array
    current_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # Calculate the difference between the current sum and the goal
    diff = abs(goal - current_sum)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of elements needed
    # Each element can contribute at most `limit` to the sum
    return (diff + limit - 1) // limit  # Equivalent to math.ceil(diff / limit)

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    nums = [1, -1, 1]
    limit = 3
    goal = -4

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- Calculating the sum of the array takes O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.
- The rest of the operations (absolute difference, division, etc.) are O(1).
- Overall time complexity: O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
- Overall space complexity: O(1).
