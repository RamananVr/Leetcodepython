LeetCode Problem 2790: Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Size

You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of students in a university.

You want to group the students into groups such that:
- Each group has a minimum of 3 students.
- In each group, all students have the same grade.
- The groups are ordered by their average grade in increasing order.

Return the maximum number of groups you can form.

Constraints:
- 3 <= grades.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= grades[i] <= 100

Example 1:
Input: grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: The students with grades [10,6,12,7,3,5] can be grouped into [3,5,6] (average 4.67), [7,10,12] (average 9.67).
We can form at most 1 group since we need at least 3 students per group.

Example 2:
Input: grades = [8,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can form groups [3,3,3] and [8,8,8]. We could also form [3,3,3,3] and [8,8,8,8], but this gives us the same number of groups.
