LeetCode Problem #2598: Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer After Operations

Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `value`.

In one operation, you can add or subtract `value` from any element of `nums`.

- For example, if `value = 2` and `nums = [1, -3, 4]`, you can choose to:
  - Add `2` to `nums[0]` to make `nums = [3, -3, 4]`
  - Subtract `2` from `nums[1]` to make `nums = [1, -5, 4]`

Your task is to find the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be represented as an element of `nums` after performing any number of such operations (including zero operations).

Return the smallest missing non-negative integer.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= value <= 10^9`

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Calculating the remainder for each element in `nums` takes O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- The loop to find the smallest missing integer runs for at most O(n) iterations.
- Overall time complexity: O(n).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The `remainder_count` array has a size of `value`, which is O(value).
- Overall space complexity: O(value).
