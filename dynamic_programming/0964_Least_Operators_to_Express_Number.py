LeetCode Problem #964: Least Operators to Express Number

Problem Statement:
Given a single positive integer `x` and another positive integer `target`, you need to express the `target` using the least number of operations. 
The allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), and you can use the number `x` as many times as you want.

You can only use integer division, and you cannot use floating-point numbers. For example, 5/2 = 2.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to express the `target`.

Constraints:
- 2 <= x <= 100
- 1 <= target <= 10^9

# Python Solution
from functools import lru_cache

def leastOpsExpressTarget(x: int, target: int) -> int:
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(target):
        if target == 0:
            return 0
        if target < x:
            return min(2 * target - 1, 2 * (x - target))  # Either add or subtract to reach target
        
        quotient, remainder = divmod(target, x)
        # Case 1: Use remainder (target % x) and recurse on quotient
        use_remainder = dfs(quotient) + remainder
        # Case 2: Use x - remainder and recurse on quotient + 1
        use_x_minus_remainder = dfs(quotient + 1) + (x - remainder)
        
        return min(use_remainder, use_x_minus_remainder) + 1  # +1 for multiplication/division operation
    
    return dfs(target)

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    x = 3
    target = 19
    print(leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target))  # Expected Output: 5

    # Test Case 2
    x = 5
    target = 501
    print(leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target))  # Expected Output: 8

    # Test Case 3
    x = 100
    target = 100000000
    print(leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target))  # Expected Output: 3

    # Test Case 4
    x = 2
    target = 125
    print(leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target))  # Expected Output: 8

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The recursive function `dfs` explores the possible ways to express the target using the given operations.
- The number of recursive calls depends on the logarithm of the target with respect to x (i.e., O(log_x(target))).
- Since we use memoization with `lru_cache`, repeated subproblems are avoided, making the solution efficient.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursion and the memoization table.
- The recursion depth is O(log_x(target)), and the memoization table stores intermediate results, which is also O(log_x(target)).
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(log_x(target)).
