2735. Collecting Chocolates

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and a non-negative integer x.

You are initially at position 0 in the array and can move to either the left or the right.

The array is circular, so when you are at position i:
- Moving to the right takes you to position (i + 1) % n
- Moving to the left takes you to position (i - 1 + n) % n

You want to collect all chocolates in the array. The cost of collecting the chocolate at position i is nums[i].

You can also perform a rotation operation any number of times. Each rotation operation costs x and shifts all elements in the array to the left by one position:
- nums becomes [nums[1], nums[2], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0]]

Return the minimum cost to collect all chocolates.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [20,1,15], x = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: Initially, the array is [20,1,15].
We can do the following operations:
- Collect the chocolate at index 1, which costs nums[1] = 1.
- Do a rotation operation, which costs x = 5. Now the array is [1,15,20].
- Collect the chocolate at index 1, which costs nums[1] = 15.
- Do a rotation operation, which costs x = 5. Now the array is [15,20,1].
- Collect the chocolate at index 1, which costs nums[1] = 20.
The total cost is 1 + 5 + 15 + 5 + 20 = 46.

Alternatively:
- Collect all chocolates at their original positions: 20 + 1 + 15 = 36.
But we can be smarter:
- Collect chocolate at index 1 (cost 1)
- Rotate once (cost 5), now [1,15,20], collect at index 1 (cost 15)  
- Rotate once (cost 5), now [15,20,1], collect at index 1 (cost 20)
Total: 1 + 5 + 15 + 5 + 20 = 46. But this is not optimal.

Actually optimal:
- Collect at index 1: cost 1
- Rotate twice (cost 10): [15,20,1] -> [20,1,15], collect at index 1: cost 1
Wait, that's not right either.

Let me recalculate: collect chocolate at position 1 (cost 1), then we need the other chocolates.
We can collect at their original positions (20 + 15 = 35) for total 36.
Or we can rotate to bring them to position 1: 
- After 1 rotation: [1,15,20], collect at pos 1 costs 15, total rotations = 1
- After 2 rotations: [15,20,1], collect at pos 1 costs 20, total rotations = 2
So strategy is: 1 + (5*1 + 15) + (5*2 + 20) = 1 + 20 + 30 = 51, which is worse.

Actually, let's collect all at once: 20 + 1 + 15 = 36.
Or collect at position with minimum after rotations:
- Position 0: 20 (0 rotations), 1 (2 rotations), 15 (1 rotation) -> min(20, 1+2*5, 15+1*5) = min(20, 11, 20) = 11
- Position 1: 1 (0 rotations), 15 (1 rotation), 20 (2 rotations) -> min(1, 15+5, 20+10) = min(1, 20, 30) = 1  
- Position 2: 15 (0 rotations), 20 (1 rotation), 1 (2 rotations) -> min(15, 20+5, 1+10) = min(15, 25, 11) = 11
Total minimum: 11 + 1 + 11 = 23.

Wait, that's not how it works. We collect ALL chocolates, so we need the sum.
Let me reconsider...

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], x = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is to collect all chocolates at their initial positions: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
- 0 <= x <= 10^9

Time Complexity Analysis:

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Basic/Optimized: O(n) - storing minimum costs array
- Brute Force: O(1) - constant extra space

Key Insights:
1. We can perform any number of rotations, each costing x
2. The goal is to minimize total cost: rotation_cost + sum_of_chocolate_costs
3. For each final position, we want the cheapest chocolate that can reach it
4. A chocolate at original position i can reach position j with (i-j)%n rotations
5. We need to balance rotation costs with chocolate savings
