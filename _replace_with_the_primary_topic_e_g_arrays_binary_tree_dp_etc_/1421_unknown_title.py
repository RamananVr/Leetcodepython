# Problem Statement:
"""
[Replace this section with the full problem statement for the intended LeetCode problem.]

# Python Solution:
def example_solution(input_data):
    """
    Replace this function with the correct solution for the intended problem.

    # Example logic (to be replaced with the actual solution)
    return input_data

# Example Test Cases:
if __name__ == "__main__":

    input_data = [1, 2, 3]
    expected_output = [1, 2, 3]
    assert example_solution(input_data) == expected_output, f"Test Case 1 Failed"

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
"""
Time Complexity: O(n) 
- Replace 'O(n)' with the actual time complexity of the solution.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Replace 'O(1)' with the actual space complexity of the solution.
