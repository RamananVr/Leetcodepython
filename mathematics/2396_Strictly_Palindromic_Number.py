LeetCode Problem #2396: Strictly Palindromic Number

Problem Statement:
An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 (inclusive), 
the string representation of the integer n in base b is a palindrome.

Given an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Constraints:
- 4 <= n <= 10^9

    """
    Determines if a number n is strictly palindromic.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The input number.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if n is strictly palindromic, False otherwise.

    # A strictly palindromic number must satisfy the condition for all bases b in [2, n-2].
    # However, it can be mathematically proven that no number n >= 4 can be strictly palindromic.
    # Hence, we can directly return False for all valid inputs.
    return False

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1: n = 4
    # Explanation: For n = 4, there are no bases b in the range [2, n-2] (inclusive).
    # Hence, it cannot be strictly palindromic.
    print(isStrictlyPalindromic(4))  # Expected output: False

    # Test Case 2: n = 5
    # Explanation: For n = 5, it can be shown that it is not strictly palindromic.
    print(isStrictlyPalindromic(5))  # Expected output: False

    # Test Case 3: n = 10
    # Explanation: For n = 10, it is not strictly palindromic.
    print(isStrictlyPalindromic(10))  # Expected output: False

    # Test Case 4: n = 1000000000
    # Explanation: For n = 10^9, it is not strictly palindromic.
    print(isStrictlyPalindromic(1000000000))  # Expected output: False

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- The function runs in O(1) time because it directly returns False without performing any computations.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The function uses O(1) space as it does not allocate any additional memory.
