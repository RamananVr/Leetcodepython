2737. Find the Closest Marked Node

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a connected undirected graph containing exactly n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi.

Finally, you are given an integer array marked which contains some of the nodes in the graph.

Return an integer denoting the minimum number of edges you need to traverse from any marked node to reach any other marked node. If it is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], marked = [0,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are several paths between nodes 0 and 3:
- 0 -> 1 -> 3: 2 edges
- 0 -> 2 -> 3: 2 edges
The minimum is 2 edges.

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6]], marked = [1,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are several paths:
- 1 -> 2: 1 edge
- 1 -> 4: 1 edge  
- 2 -> 4: 1 edge
The minimum is 1 edge.

Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], marked = [0,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The only path between 0 and 3 is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3: 3 edges.

Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 500
- 1 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n-1) / 2, 2000)
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < n
- ai != bi
- edges[i] does not contain repeated edges.
- 1 <= marked.length <= min(n, 100)

Time Complexity Analysis:
- BFS Solution: O(|marked| * (n + m)) - BFS from each marked node
- Multi-source BFS: O(n + m) - single BFS traversal
- Floyd-Warshall: O(n^3) - all-pairs shortest paths

Space Complexity Analysis:
- BFS: O(n + m) - graph representation and BFS queue
- Multi-source BFS: O(n + m) - similar to BFS
- Floyd-Warshall: O(n^2) - distance matrix

Key Insights:
1. We need shortest path between any two marked nodes
2. BFS gives shortest path in unweighted graphs
3. Multi-source BFS can be more efficient when we have multiple sources
4. Floyd-Warshall is overkill but works for dense graphs
5. Graph connectivity affects whether a solution exists
