LeetCode Problem #2092: Find All People With Secret

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer `n` indicating the number of people labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. 
You are also given a 2D integer array `meetings`, where `meetings[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]` indicates that person `x_i` and person `y_i` met at time `time_i`, and a person may share a secret with the other person at the meeting if either of them knows the secret. 
Initially, only person `0` knows the secret. You are also given an integer `firstPerson` that indicates that person `firstPerson` is the first person that person `0` shares the secret with.

Return a list of all the people that know the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:
1. `2 <= n <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`
3. `meetings[i].length == 3`
4. `0 <= x_i, y_i <= n - 1`
5. `x_i != y_i`
6. `1 <= time_i <= 10^9`
7. `1 <= firstPerson <= n - 1`

The meetings are not necessarily sorted in increasing order of time.

Time Complexity:
- Sorting the meetings by time: O(m log m), where m is the number of meetings.
- BFS for each time group: O(m + n), where m is the number of edges (meetings) and n is the number of nodes (people).
- Overall: O(m log m + m + n) â‰ˆ O(m log m), since m dominates n in most cases.

Space Complexity:
- Storing the graph for each time group: O(m).
- BFS queue and visited set: O(n).
- Overall: O(m + n).
