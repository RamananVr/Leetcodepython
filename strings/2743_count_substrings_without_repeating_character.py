LeetCode Problem 2743: Count Substrings Without Repeating Character

Given a string s, return the number of substrings that do not have any repeating character.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 21
Explanation: 
The substrings without repeating characters are:
"a" (appears 2 times), "b" (appears 2 times), "c" (appears 2 times),
"ab" (appears 2 times), "bc" (appears 2 times), "ca" (appears 1 time),
"abc" (appears 2 times), "bca" (appears 1 time), "cab" (appears 1 time)
Total: 2*3 + 2*3 + 1 + 2*3 + 1 + 1 = 21

Example 2:
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The substrings without repeating characters are:
"a" (appears 2 times), "b" (appears 1 time), "ab" (appears 1 time)
Total: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

Example 3:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The substrings without repeating characters are:
"a" (appears 3 times)
Total: 3

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

Complexity Analysis:

1. Sliding Window (numberOfUniqueSubstrings):
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - each character processed at most twice
   - Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) - hash map for character positions

2. Two Pointers (numberOfUniqueSubstringsOptimized):
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - each character added/removed from set at most once
   - Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) - set for tracking characters

3. Last Seen Array (numberOfUniqueSubstringsWithLastSeen):
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass through string
   - Space Complexity: O(1) - fixed size array for 26 lowercase letters

4. Brute Force (numberOfUniqueSubstringsBrute):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^3) - check all substrings and validate each
   - Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) - for substring character checking

Key Insights:
- For each ending position, count how many valid starting positions exist
- Use sliding window to maintain substring without repeating characters
- When duplicate found, move start pointer to position after last occurrence
- Total substrings ending at position i = (i - start + 1)

Similar Problems:
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Subarrays with K Different Integers
- Fruit Into Baskets
