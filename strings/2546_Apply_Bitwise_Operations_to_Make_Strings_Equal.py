LeetCode Problem #2546: Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal

Problem Statement:
You are given two binary strings s1 and s2 of the same length. The binary string s1 can be transformed into s2 if and only if there exists a sequence of operations that can be applied to s1 to make it equal to s2. In one operation, you can:
- Choose any two indices i and j (i â‰  j) and swap s1[i] with s1[j].
- Choose any index i and flip the value of s1[i] (i.e., change '0' to '1' or '1' to '0').

Return true if it is possible to transform s1 into s2. Otherwise, return false.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s1.length == s2.length <= 10^5
- s1 and s2 consist of only the characters '0' and '1'.

    Determines if binary string s1 can be transformed into binary string s2
    using the given operations.

    Args:
    s1 (str): The initial binary string.
    s2 (str): The target binary string.

    Returns:
    bool: True if s1 can be transformed into s2, False otherwise.

    # If s1 and s2 have different counts of '1', transformation is impossible.

    s1 = "0000"

    s2 = "1111"
    print(makeStringsEqual(s1, s2))  # Output: True

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The solution involves checking whether '1' exists in both s1 and s2.
- This operation takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the strings.

Space Complexity:
- The solution uses O(1) additional space since no extra data structures are used.
