LeetCode Problem 2745: Construct the Longest New String

You are given three integers x, y, and z.

You have x strings equal to "AA", y strings equal to "BB", and z strings equal to "AB".

You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order 
to form a new string. This new string must not contain "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring.

Return the maximum possible length of such a string.

Example 1:
Input: x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: We can concatenate the strings "AA" + "AB" + "BB" + "AA" to get "AABBBAA".
- "AA" appears at indices 0-1 and 6-7.
- "AB" appears at index 2-3.
- "BB" appears at index 4-5.
- "AAA" does not appear as a substring.
- "BBB" does not appear as a substring.
Length is 8.

Example 2:
Input: x = 5, y = 1, z = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: We can concatenate "AA" + "AB" + "BB" + "AB" + "AA" + "AA" to get "AABBABAAAA".
However, we need to be careful about "AAA". One valid arrangement is "ABAA" + "BBAB" + "AA" + "AA".
Actually, optimal might be "AA" + "AB" + "BB" + "AB" + "AA" + "AA" = "AABBBABAAAA" (length 11).
Let me recalculate: "AB" + "AA" + "BB" + "AB" + "AA" + "AA" = "ABAABBABAAAA" (length 12).

Example 3:
Input: x = 3, y = 2, z = 2
Output: 14
Explanation: We can use all strings. One possible arrangement: 
"AB" + "AA" + "BB" + "AB" + "AA" + "BB" + "AA" = "ABAABBABAABBAA" (length 14).

Constraints:
- 1 <= x, y, z <= 50

- All "AB" pieces can always be used (contribute 2z to length)
- "AA" and "BB" pieces must be alternated to avoid "AAA" or "BBB"
- If |x - y| â‰¤ 1, all "AA" and "BB" pieces can be used

- The optimal solution follows a mathematical pattern
