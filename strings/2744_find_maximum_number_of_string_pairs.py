LeetCode Problem 2744: Find Maximum Number of String Pairs

You are given a 0-indexed array words consisting of distinct strings.

The task is to find the maximum number of string pairs that can be formed from the array where:
- words[i] and words[j] form a pair if one string is the reverse of the other.
- Each string can be used in at most one pair.

Return the maximum number of string pairs that can be formed.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["cd","ac","dc","ca","zz"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
In this example, we can form 2 pairs:
- ("cd", "dc")
- ("ac", "ca")
The string "zz" cannot form a pair because its reverse is itself, and each string can only be used once.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["ab","ba","cc"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
In this example, we can form 1 pair:
- ("ab", "ba")
The string "cc" cannot form a pair because its reverse is itself.

Example 3:
Input: words = ["aa","ab"]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
In this example, we cannot form any pairs. "aa" reversed is "aa", and "ab" reversed is "ba" which is not in the array.

Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 300
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.

Complexity Analysis:

1. Hash Set Approach (maximumNumberOfStringPairs):
   - Time Complexity: O(n * m) - iterate through words, reverse each word
   - Space Complexity: O(n * m) - store all words and used set

2. Counter Approach (maximumNumberOfStringPairsCounter):
   - Time Complexity: O(n * m) - similar to hash set approach
   - Space Complexity: O(n * m) - counter and processed set

3. Grouping Approach (maximumNumberOfStringPairsGrouping):
   - Time Complexity: O(n * m) - group words by canonical form
   - Space Complexity: O(n * m) - store groups

4. Optimal Approach (maximumNumberOfStringPairsOptimal):
   - Time Complexity: O(n * m) - single pass through words
   - Space Complexity: O(n * m) - seen set (but removes paired words)

5. Brute Force (maximumNumberOfStringPairsBruteForce):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2 * m) - check all pairs
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - used array

Key Insights:
- Each word can be used at most once
- A word pairs with its reverse if both exist and are different
- Palindromes cannot form pairs with themselves (would violate "each string used once" rule)
- The optimal approach processes words in one pass, removing paired words immediately

Edge Cases:
- Palindromic words (cannot pair with themselves)
- Single character words
- Empty input
- All words are unique (no duplicates to worry about)
