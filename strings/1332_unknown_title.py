LeetCode Problem #1332: Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b', you can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Remove a non-empty palindromic subsequence from `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: The entire string is a palindrome, so it can be removed in a single step.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" is not a palindrome, so we can first remove "bb" and then "a".

Example 3:
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can first remove "baab" (a palindrome) and then "b".

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Checking if the string is empty takes O(1).
- Checking if the string is a palindrome takes O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional data structures.
