LeetCode Problem #2697: Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome

Problem Statement:
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:
- Choose any two characters in the string and replace them with the lexicographically smaller of the two.

Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists of lowercase English letters.

Example:
Input: s = "egcfe"
Output: "efcfe"
Explanation: The characters at indices 0 and 4 are replaced by 'e', and the characters at indices 1 and 3 are replaced by 'f'.

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "abba"
Explanation: The characters at indices 0 and 3 are replaced by 'a', and the characters at indices 1 and 2 are replaced by 'b'.

Input: s = "seven"
Output: "neven"
Explanation: The characters at indices 0 and 4 are replaced by 'n', and the characters at indices 1 and 3 are replaced by 'e'.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm iterates over half of the string (n // 2 iterations), where n is the length of the string.
- Each iteration involves a constant-time operation (finding the minimum of two characters and assigning values).
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm uses O(n) space to store the mutable list representation of the string.
- No additional data structures are used, so the space complexity is O(n).
