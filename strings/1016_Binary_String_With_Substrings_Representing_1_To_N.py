LeetCode Problem #1016: Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N

Problem Statement:
Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`, return true if the binary representation of every integer 
in the range [1, n] is a substring of `s`, or false otherwise.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "0110", n = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representations of 1, 2, and 3 are "1", "10", and "11", respectively. All of them are substrings of "0110".

Example 2:
Input: s = "0110", n = 4
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 4 is "100", which is not a substring of "0110".

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
- 1 <= n <= 10^9

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- The loop iterates over all integers from 1 to n. For each integer, we compute its binary representation (O(log(num)) time)
  and check if it is a substring of `s` (O(len(s)) time).
- In the worst case, the total time complexity is O(n * (log(n) + len(s))).
- However, since n can be very large (up to 10^9), the function will likely be infeasible for large n.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is O(log(n)) due to the storage of the binary representation of each number.
