2734. Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation

You are given a string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:
- Select any non-empty substring of s.
- Replace every letter in the substring with the previous letter in the English alphabet. For example 'b' becomes 'a', 'c' becomes 'b', and so on. The letter 'a' becomes 'z'.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after performing exactly one operation.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "cbabc"
Output: "baabc"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the substring starting at index 0, and ending at index 1 inclusive.
It can be shown that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:
Input: s = "acbbc"
Output: "aabbc"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the substring starting at index 1, and ending at index 1 inclusive.
It can be shown that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest.

Example 3:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: "aaz"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the substring starting at index 2, and ending at index 2 inclusive.
It can be shown that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Basic/Greedy/Optimal: O(n) - single pass through string
- Brute Force: O(n^3) - trying all O(n^2) substrings, each requiring O(n) operations

Space Complexity Analysis:
- All solutions: O(n) - creating result string

Key Insights:
1. To get lexicographically smallest result, we should make changes as early as possible
2. Converting 'a' to 'z' makes the string larger, so avoid if possible
3. The optimal strategy is to find the first non-'a' character and convert consecutive non-'a' characters
4. If all characters are 'a', we must convert exactly one, so convert the last one to minimize impact
5. Greedy approach works because earlier positions have higher priority in lexicographic comparison
