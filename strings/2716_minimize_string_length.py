LeetCode Problem #2716: Minimize String Length

Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed string `s`. Repeatedly perform the following operation until it is no longer possible:
- Choose an index `i` such that there is at least one character to the left of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`, and at least one character to the right of index `i` that is equal to `s[i]`.
- Delete the character at index `i`.

Return the length of the final string after performing the above operation repeatedly.

Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

Brute Force Simulation:

Optimized Solution:
- Time complexity: O(n) for scanning the string once to find unique characters.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Space complexity: O(1) for the optimized solution (considering only lowercase English letters).
