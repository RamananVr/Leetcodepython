2730. Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring

You are given a 0-indexed string s that consists of digits from 0 to 9.

A string is called semi-repetitive if there is at most one adjacent pair of the same digit.
For example, "0010", "002020", "0123", "2002", and "54944" are semi-repetitive while 
"00101022", and "1101234" are not.

Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring of s.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "52233"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223", which starts at i = 0 and ends at i = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "5494"
Output: 4
Explanation: s is semi-repetitive, so the answer is 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "1111111"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest semi-repetitive substring is "11", which starts at i = 0 and ends at i = 1.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 50
- s consists only of digits from 0 to 9.

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sliding Window: O(n) - each character is visited at most twice
- Brute Force: O(n^3) - checking all O(n^2) substrings, each takes O(n)
- Optimized: O(n) - single pass with better tracking

Space Complexity Analysis:
- All solutions: O(1) - using constant extra space

Key Insights:
1. Sliding window technique is perfect for this constraint-based substring problem
2. We need to track at most one adjacent pair in a valid substring
3. When we encounter a second adjacent pair, we need to move the left boundary
4. The optimized version tracks the position of the last adjacent pair for efficiency
