LeetCode Problem 2746: Decremental String Concatenation

You are given a 0-indexed array words of n strings.

Let joinedString be a string formed by concatenating all strings in words[0] to words[i] where i < n. 
In other words, joinedString = words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[i].

Return the minimum possible length of the string after removing exactly one occurrence of any substring 
from joinedString that appears at least twice.

If no such substring exists, return the length of joinedString.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["aa","ab","aa"]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
joinedString = "aa" + "ab" + "aa" = "aaabaa"
The substring "aa" appears twice (at indices 0-1 and 4-5).
Removing one occurrence: "aaabaa" -> "abaa" (length 4) or "aaab" (length 4).

Example 2:
Input: words = ["ab","b"]  
Output: 2
Explanation:
joinedString = "ab" + "b" = "abb"
The substring "b" appears twice (at indices 1 and 2).
Removing one occurrence: "abb" -> "ab" (length 2) or "ab" (length 2).

Example 3:
Input: words = ["aaa"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
joinedString = "aaa"
The substring "a" appears three times. Removing one: "aaa" -> "aa" (length 2).
The substring "aa" appears twice. Removing one: "aaa" -> "a" (length 1).
We want minimum length, so we remove "aa" to get length 1.
Wait, that's wrong. Let me recalculate:
"a" appears 3 times, "aa" appears 2 times, "aaa" appears 1 time.
Removing "aa": "aaa" -> "a" (length 1). This gives minimum length.

Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

"""
Complexity Analysis:

1. Brute Force (minimumLength):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^3) - generate all substrings and count occurrences
   - Space Complexity: O(n^2) - store all substrings in hash map

2. Optimized (minimumLengthOptimized):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^3) - but with early termination when longer duplicate found
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - only store substrings of current length being checked

3. Rolling Hash (minimumLengthRollingHash):
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2) average case - rolling hash reduces string comparison cost
   - Space Complexity: O(n) - hash map for current length substrings

Key Insights:
- We want to remove the longest possible substring that appears at least twice
- This minimizes the final string length
- All substrings need to be considered, but we can optimize by checking longest first
- Rolling hash can speed up duplicate detection

Edge Cases:
- Single word with no repeated substrings
- All words are the same
- Single character strings
- Empty input

Optimization Strategies:
- Check substring lengths from longest to shortest
- Use rolling hash for faster string comparison
- Early termination when longer duplicate is found
