2738. Count Occurrences in Text

Given a string text and a string pattern, return the number of times pattern occurs in text.

Overlapping occurrences count as separate occurrences.

Example 1:
Input: text = "abcabc", pattern = "abc"
Output: 2
Explanation: The pattern "abc" occurs at indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:
Input: text = "aaaa", pattern = "aa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The pattern "aa" occurs at indices 0, 1, and 2 (overlapping occurrences).

Example 3:
Input: text = "abc", pattern = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: The pattern "def" does not occur in "abc".

Constraints:
- 1 <= text.length <= 1000
- 1 <= pattern.length <= 100
- text and pattern consist of only lowercase English letters.

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Naive Solution: O(n * m) - checking each position with pattern comparison
- KMP Algorithm: O(n + m) - linear preprocessing and searching
- Rolling Hash: O(n + m) average, O(n * m) worst case due to hash collisions
- Z Algorithm: O(n + m) - linear time construction and search

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Naive: O(1) - constant extra space
- KMP: O(m) - LPS array for pattern
- Rolling Hash: O(1) - constant extra space
- Z Algorithm: O(n + m) - combined string and Z array

Key Insights:
1. Overlapping occurrences must be counted separately
2. Naive approach is simple but can be slow for large inputs
3. KMP provides optimal time complexity with reasonable space usage
4. Rolling hash offers good average-case performance
5. Z algorithm is elegant and provides linear time guarantees
6. The choice of algorithm depends on the expected input characteristics
