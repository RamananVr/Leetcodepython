LeetCode Problem #2693: Call Function with Custom Context

Problem Statement:
You are given a function `fn` and a context object `context`. Your task is to implement a function `callWithContext` that takes these two arguments and returns the result of calling `fn` with the given context.

The function `fn` should be called with the `this` keyword set to the `context` object. In Python, this is equivalent to binding the function to the context object and then invoking it.

Example:
    Input:
        fn = lambda: this.x + this.y
        context = {"x": 2, "y": 3}
    Output:
        5

Constraints:
- The `fn` function will always be a valid callable.
- The `context` object will always be a valid dictionary.
- The function `fn` will not have any side effects.
"""

# Solution
def callWithContext(fn, context):
    """
    Calls the given function `fn` with the provided `context` as its execution context.

    Args:
        fn (callable): The function to be called.
        context (dict): The context object to bind to the function.

    Returns:
        Any: The result of calling `fn` with the given context.
    """
    # Use Python's `types.MethodType` to bind the function to the context
    from types import MethodType
    bound_fn = MethodType(fn, context)
    return bound_fn()

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    fn1 = lambda self: self["x"] + self["y"]
    context1 = {"x": 2, "y": 3}
    print(callWithContext(fn1, context1))  # Output: 5

    # Test Case 2
    fn2 = lambda self: self["a"] * self["b"]
    context2 = {"a": 4, "b": 5}
    print(callWithContext(fn2, context2))  # Output: 20

    # Test Case 3
    fn3 = lambda self: self["name"].upper()
    context3 = {"name": "leetcode"}
    print(callWithContext(fn3, context3))  # Output: "LEETCODE"

    # Test Case 4
    fn4 = lambda self: len(self["items"])
    context4 = {"items": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
    print(callWithContext(fn4, context4))  # Output: 5

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this function is O(1) for the binding operation and O(f) for the execution of the function `fn`, 
  where `f` is the time complexity of the function `fn` itself. 
  Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(f).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures or memory apart from the function binding.

Note: The actual complexity depends on the implementation of `fn`.
