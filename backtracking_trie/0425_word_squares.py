LeetCode Question #425: Word Squares

Problem Statement:
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball", "area", "lead", "lady"] forms a word square because:
    b a l l
    a r e a
    l e a d
    l a d y

Note:
1. There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
2. All words will have the same length.
3. Words consist of only lowercase English letters.

You need to return all possible word squares.

Example:
Input: ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output: [
    ["wall","area","lead","lady"],
    ["ball","area","lead","lady"]
]

Constraints:
- The input list of words will not contain duplicates.
- All words will have the same length.

Time Complexity:
- Let n be the length of each word and k be the number of words.
- Building the prefix map takes O(k * n) time.
- The backtracking process explores all possible word squares. In the worst case, there are k^n possible word squares, and for each square, we spend O(n^2) time to construct prefixes.
- Overall time complexity: O(k * n + k^n * n^2).

Space Complexity:
- The prefix map requires O(k * n) space.
- The recursion stack can go as deep as n, and each stack frame uses O(n) space for the current square.
- Overall space complexity: O(k * n + n^2).
