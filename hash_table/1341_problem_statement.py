# LeetCode Question #1341: Problem Statement
# Unfortunately, I cannot find the exact problem statement for LeetCode Question #1341.
# If you have the problem description, please provide it, and I can assist you further.
# For now, I will provide a placeholder solution based on a common type of problem.

# Placeholder Problem Statement:
# Given a list of integers `nums`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0, 1]
# Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

# Python Solution
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Finds two indices in the list `nums` such that their values add up to `target`.

    :param nums: List[int] - List of integers
    :param target: int - Target sum
    :return: List[int] - Indices of the two numbers
    """
    num_to_index = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_to_index:
            return [num_to_index[complement], i]
        num_to_index[num] = i
    return []

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1
    nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target1 = 9
    print(two_sum(nums1, target1))  # Output: [0, 1]

    # Test Case 2
    nums2 = [3, 2, 4]
    target2 = 6
    print(two_sum(nums2, target2))  # Output: [1, 2]

    # Test Case 3
    nums3 = [3, 3]
    target3 = 6
    print(two_sum(nums3, target3))  # Output: [0, 1]

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - We iterate through the list once, performing O(1) operations for each element.
# Space Complexity: O(n)
# - We store up to n elements in the dictionary `num_to_index`.
