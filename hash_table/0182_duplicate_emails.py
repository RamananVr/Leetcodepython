LeetCode Question #182: Duplicate Emails

Problem Statement:
Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named `Person`.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

For the above table, your query should return the following result:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+

Note:
- The `Id` column is the primary key for this table.
- Your output should not contain duplicate emails.

Since this is a SQL problem, we will simulate the solution in Python for educational purposes.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- Extracting emails from the input list takes O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `person` table.
- Counting the occurrences of each email using `Counter` also takes O(n).
- Filtering the duplicates from the `Counter` dictionary takes O(m), where m is the number of unique emails.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m). In the worst case, m â‰ˆ n, so the complexity simplifies to O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The `emails` list requires O(n) space to store all email addresses.
- The `Counter` dictionary requires O(m) space to store the counts of unique emails.
- The `duplicates` list requires O(k) space, where k is the number of duplicate emails.
- Overall, the space complexity is O(n + m + k). In the worst case, this simplifies to O(n).
