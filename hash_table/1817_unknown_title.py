LeetCode Problem #1817: Finding the Users Active Minutes (UAM)

Problem Statement:
You are given the logs of user activity on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]` indicates that the user with ID `IDi` performed an activity at the minute `timei`.

The "user active minutes" (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an activity on LeetCode. A userâ€™s UAM is considered `x` if the user performed activities in `x` unique minutes.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (1 <= j <= k), `answer[j - 1]` is the number of users whose UAM equals `j`.

Return the array `answer` as described above.

Constraints:
- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= IDi <= 10^9`
- `1 <= timei <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Step 1: Iterating through `logs` takes O(n), where n is the length of the logs array.
- Step 2: Iterating through `user_minutes` takes O(u), where u is the number of unique users. For each user, adding to the set takes O(1) on average.
- Step 3: Iterating through `uam_count` takes O(k) in the worst case.
Overall time complexity: O(n + u + k).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The `user_minutes` dictionary stores up to O(u * m) unique entries, where u is the number of unique users and m is the average number of unique minutes per user.
- The `uam_count` dictionary stores up to O(k) entries.
Overall space complexity: O(u * m + k).
