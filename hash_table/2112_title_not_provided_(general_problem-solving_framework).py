# LeetCode Problem #2112: Title Not Provided (General Problem-Solving Framework)

"""
Problem Statement:
This problem appears to be a general framework for solving LeetCode problems, emphasizing structured problem-solving techniques.
Since no specific problem is provided, we will demonstrate a solution to a common LeetCode problem: "Two Sum".

Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example:
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, so return [0, 1].

        Finds two numbers in the list that add up to the target and returns their indices.

        Args:
        nums (list[int]): List of integers.
        target (int): Target sum.

        Returns:
        list[int]: Indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

"""
Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through the list once, performing constant-time operations for each element.
- The dictionary lookup and insertion are O(1) on average.
- Overall time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a dictionary to store up to n elements.
- Overall space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
