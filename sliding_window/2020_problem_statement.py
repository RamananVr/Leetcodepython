LeetCode Question #2020: Problem Statement

(Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, LeetCode does not have a Question #2020. 
For the purpose of this task, I will create a hypothetical problem statement.)

Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum sum of any 
contiguous subarray of length `k`. If the array has fewer than `k` elements, return 0.

Example:
Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: The subarray [5, 1, 3] has the maximum sum of 9.

Input: nums = [2, 3], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The array has fewer than 3 elements, so the result is 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= 10^5

    """
    Finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length k.

    :param nums: List[int] - The input array of integers.
    :param k: int - The length of the subarray.
    :return: int - The maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of length k, or 0 if not possible.

    # If the array has fewer than k elements, return 0
    if len(nums) < k:
        return 0

    # Initialize the sliding window sum and the maximum sum
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    # Slide the window across the array
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        # Update the window sum by adding the next element and removing the first element of the previous window
        window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        # Update the maximum sum

    k4 = 2
    print(max_sum_of_subarray(nums4, k4))  # Output: -3

    # Test Case 5
    nums5 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    k5 = 1
    print(max_sum_of_subarray(nums5, k5))  # Output: 50

"""
Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through the array once, performing O(1) operations for each element.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
