LeetCode Problem #3000: [Hypothetical Problem Title]
(Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, LeetCode does not have a Problem #3000. 
This is a hypothetical problem created for demonstration purposes.)

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. If the array has fewer than `k` elements, return 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= len(nums)

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20], k = 4
Output: 39
Explanation: The subarray [4, 2, 10, 23] has the maximum sum of 39.

Input: nums = [2, 3], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The array has fewer than k elements, so the result is 0.

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm uses a sliding window approach, where we iterate through the array once.
- Calculating the sum of the first window takes O(k), and sliding the window across the array takes O(n - k).
- Overall time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
- Overall space complexity: O(1).
