LeetCode Problem #2647: Color the Triangle

Problem Statement:
You are given a triangle represented as a 2D array `triangle` where `triangle[i]` is the i-th row of the triangle. Each element in the triangle is either 0 or 1. You need to color the triangle such that no two adjacent elements in the same row or column have the same color. Return the minimum number of colors required to achieve this.

Constraints:
- The triangle will have at most 100 rows.
- Each row will have at most 100 elements.
- The triangle is guaranteed to be a valid triangle (i.e., the i-th row has exactly i elements).

Example:
Input: triangle = [[0], [1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can color the triangle using 2 colors such that no two adjacent elements have the same color.

Note:
- The problem is essentially about graph coloring, where each element in the triangle is a node, and edges exist between adjacent elements.

    """
    Function to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the triangle.
    
    :param triangle: List[List[int]] - 2D array representing the triangle
    :return: int - Minimum number of colors required

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the triangle.
Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of elements in the triangle.
