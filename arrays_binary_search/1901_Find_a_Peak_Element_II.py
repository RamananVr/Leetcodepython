LeetCode Problem #1901: Find a Peak Element II

Problem Statement:
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors. 
You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix `mat` where no two adjacent cells are equal. 
Find any peak element `mat[i][j]` and return the position `[i, j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log n) or O(n log m) time.

Constraints:
- m == mat.length
- n == mat[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 500
- 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^5
- All elements in `mat` are distinct.

Example:
Input: mat = [[1, 4], [3, 2]]
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Both 4 and 3 are peak elements, so either [0,1] or [1,0] is acceptable.

Follow-up:
Can you solve the problem in O(m log n) or O(n log m) time?

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The algorithm performs a binary search on the columns, which takes O(log n) time.
- For each column, it scans all rows to find the maximum element, which takes O(m) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m log n).

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
