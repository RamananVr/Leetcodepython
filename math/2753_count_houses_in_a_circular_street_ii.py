LeetCode Problem 2753: Count Houses in a Circular Street II

You are given an object street of class Street that represents a circular street and a positive integer k. There are houses numbered from 0 to n - 1.

Initially, you are standing in front of house 0. You can perform one of the following operations any number of times:
- Move to the next house: street.moveRight()
- Move to the previous house: street.moveLeft()
- Check if the current house is painted: street.isDoorOpen()

Note that the street is circular, which means the next house of house n - 1 is house 0, and the previous house of house 0 is house n - 1.

The street object has the following methods:
- void moveRight(): Move to the next house in the circular street.
- void moveLeft(): Move to the previous house in the circular street.
- boolean isDoorOpen(): Return true if the door is open (house is painted), false otherwise.

It is guaranteed that exactly k houses are painted, and they are evenly distributed. For example, if n = 6 and k = 3, then houses 0, 2, and 4 are painted.

Return the number of houses in the street (the length of the array).

Example 1:
Input: street = [1,0,1,0,1,0], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 houses, and exactly 3 of them are painted (houses 0, 2, 4).
Since k = 3 and the houses are evenly distributed, the distance between painted houses is 6/3 = 2.

Example 2:
Input: street = [1,0,0,1,0,0], k = 2  
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 houses, and exactly 2 of them are painted (houses 0, 3).
Since k = 2 and the houses are evenly distributed, the distance between painted houses is 6/2 = 3.

Constraints:
- n == street.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^4
- k == number of painted houses
- 1 <= k <= n/2
- Exactly k houses are painted and evenly distributed
- The input is generated such that there is exactly one valid answer

Complexity Analysis:

1. Main Approach (houseCount):
   - Time Complexity: O(n/k) - distance between painted houses is n/k
   - Space Complexity: O(1) - only using constant extra space

2. Optimal Approach (houseCountOptimal):
   - Time Complexity: O(n/k) - same as main approach
   - Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space

3. Validation Approach (houseCountValidation):
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - makes complete circle to verify
   - Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space

4. Brute Force (houseCountBruteForce):
   - Time Complexity: O(n) - visits every house
   - Space Complexity: O(k) - stores painted house positions

Key Insights:
- Since painted houses are evenly distributed, distance between consecutive painted houses is n/k
- We only need to find the distance to the next painted house from our starting position
- Total houses = distance_between_painted_houses * k
- This leverages the mathematical property of even distribution

Algorithm:
1. Start at house 0 (or any position)
2. Move right until finding the next painted house
3. Count the moves (this gives us the spacing)
4. Multiply by k to get total houses

Edge Cases:
- Minimum case: 2 houses
- All painted houses are adjacent (k = n/2)
- Large spacing between painted houses
- Starting at painted vs unpainted house

Optimization:
- The key insight is that we don't need to visit all houses
- Mathematical property of even distribution allows us to extrapolate
- Expected time is much better than O(n) in most cases
