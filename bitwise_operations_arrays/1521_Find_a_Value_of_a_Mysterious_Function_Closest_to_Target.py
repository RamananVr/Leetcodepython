LeetCode Problem #1521: Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target

Problem Statement:
You are given a function `f(x, y)` that produces a bitwise AND value of `x` and `y`.
You are also given an integer array `arr` and an integer `target`.

Return the closest value to `target` that can be obtained by applying the function `f` to any subarray of `arr`.

In other words, find `x` such that:
- `x` is the result of `f(arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j])` for some subarray `arr[i...j]` (with `i <= j`).
- `abs(x - target)` is minimized.

If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Constraints:
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
- 0 <= target <= 10^6

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The outer loop iterates over the array, so it runs O(n) times.
- The inner loop processes the current set, which can contain up to O(log(max(arr))) elements due to the nature of bitwise AND.
- Therefore, the total complexity is approximately O(n * log(max(arr))).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the size of the current set, which can contain up to O(log(max(arr))) elements.
- Thus, the space complexity is O(log(max(arr))).
