LeetCode Problem #2234: Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens

Problem Statement:
You are given two arrays `flowers` and `newFlowers`, both of size `n`. The `flowers[i]` array represents the number of flowers in the i-th garden, and `newFlowers[i]` represents the maximum number of new flowers you can add to the i-th garden.

The beauty of a garden is defined as the number of flowers in it. The total beauty of all gardens is the sum of the beauty of each garden. You are tasked to maximize the total beauty of all gardens by distributing the new flowers optimally.

Return the maximum total beauty of all gardens.

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= flowers[i], newFlowers[i] <= 10^9`

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- Sorting the gardens by the number of flowers takes O(n log n).
- Distributing the new flowers optimally involves iterating through the gardens, which takes O(n).
- Overall time complexity: O(n log n).

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, apart from the input arrays.
- Overall space complexity: O(1).
