LeetCode Problem #2900: Problem Statement

Given the problem number #2900, the exact problem statement is not available as of the knowledge cutoff date (October 2023). 
However, I will provide a generic template for solving a hypothetical problem based on common LeetCode patterns.

If you have the exact problem statement, please provide it, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

For now, let's assume the problem involves a common algorithmic challenge, such as finding the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Solution: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Args:
    s (str): Input string.

    Returns:
    int: Length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

# Example Test Cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test Case 1: General case with repeating characters
    s1 = "abcabcbb"
    print(length_of_longest_substring(s1))  # Expected output: 3 ("abc")

    # Test Case 2: String with all unique characters
    s2 = "abcdef"
    print(length_of_longest_substring(s2))  # Expected output: 6 ("abcdef")

    # Test Case 3: String with all identical characters
    s3 = "aaaaaa"
    print(length_of_longest_substring(s3))  # Expected output: 1 ("a")

    # Test Case 4: Empty string
    s4 = ""
    print(length_of_longest_substring(s4))  # Expected output: 0

    # Test Case 5: String with spaces and special characters
    s5 = "a b c!@#"
    print(length_of_longest_substring(s5))  # Expected output: 8 ("a b c!@#")

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
The algorithm iterates through the string once, and the inner while loop ensures that each character is processed at most twice.
Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).
This is because the set `char_set` stores unique characters from the substring.

Overall:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(min(n, m))
