LeetCode Problem #2342: Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits

Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j`, and the sum of digits of the number `nums[i]` is equal to the sum of digits of the number `nums[j]`.

Return the maximum value of `nums[i] + nums[j]` that you can obtain over all possible indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the condition. If no such indices exist, return `-1`.

Example:
Input: nums = [51, 71, 17, 42]
Output: 93
Explanation:
- The sum of digits of 51 is 5 + 1 = 6, and the sum of digits of 42 is 4 + 2 = 6.
- The sum of digits of 71 is 7 + 1 = 8, and the sum of digits of 17 is 1 + 7 = 8.
- The maximum sum of nums[i] + nums[j] where the sum of digits of nums[i] equals the sum of digits of nums[j] is 93 (51 + 42).

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- Calculating the digit sum for a number takes O(log10(n)) time, where n is the number of digits in the number.
- For all numbers in the array, the total time complexity is O(N * D), where N is the length of the array and D is the average number of digits in the numbers.
- In the worst case, D = log10(10^9) = 9, so the time complexity is approximately O(N).

Space Complexity:
- We use a dictionary to store the maximum number for each digit sum. In the worst case, there are at most 81 unique digit sums (since the maximum digit sum for a number â‰¤ 10^9 is 81).
- Thus, the space complexity is O(1) with respect to the size of the dictionary, and O(N) for the input array.
