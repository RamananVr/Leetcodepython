LeetCode Problem #2777: Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Array A to Array B

Problem Statement:
You are given two integer arrays `A` and `B` of length `n` and `m` respectively. 
You can perform the following operation on array `A` any number of times:
- Choose any subarray of `A` and replace all the elements in that subarray with the same integer.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `A` equal to `B`. 
If it is impossible to make `A` equal to `B`, return -1.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n, m <= 1000
- 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 1000

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Checking if B is a subsequence of A: O(n + m), where n is the length of A and m is the length of B.
- Compressing B: O(m).
- Sliding window approach to calculate minimum operations: O(n * m), where n is the length of A and m is the length of compressed B.
Overall Time Complexity: O(n * m).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- Space used for the `dp` dictionary: O(n), where n is the length of A.
- Space used for the compressed B array: O(m), where m is the length of B.
Overall Space Complexity: O(n + m).
