LeetCode Problem #1173: Immediate Food Delivery I

Problem Statement:
Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
| delivery_date               | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about food delivery orders.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of orders that were delivered on the customerâ€™s preferred delivery date.

Return the result as a single row with the following column:
- immediate_percentage: The percentage of immediate deliveries rounded to 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example:

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+---------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date | delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  | 2019-08-02    |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  | 2019-08-03    |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-03 | 2019-08-03                  | 2019-08-03    |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-04 | 2019-08-05                  | 2019-08-05    |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+--------------------+
| 50.00              |
+--------------------+
In the above table, the customer with delivery_id = 1 and delivery_id = 3 wanted the delivery on 2019-08-02 and 2019-08-03 respectively, and both were delivered on the preferred dates. So the immediate_percentage is (2/4) * 100 = 50.00
"""

# Solution:
# Since this is an SQL problem, we will write the SQL query to solve it.

"""
SQL Query:
SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN customer_pref_delivery_date = delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM 
    Delivery;

# Example Test Cases:
# The test cases are based on the example provided in the problem statement.

# Input:
# Delivery table:

# Output:
# +--------------------+
# | immediate_percentage |
# +--------------------+
# | 50.00              |
# +--------------------+

# Time Complexity Analysis:
# The SQL query involves a single table scan to calculate the total count of rows and the count of rows where the preferred delivery date matches the actual delivery date. 
# Assuming `n` is the number of rows in the `Delivery` table:
# - Time Complexity: O(n), as we are scanning the table once.
# - Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional space is used apart from the query execution.
