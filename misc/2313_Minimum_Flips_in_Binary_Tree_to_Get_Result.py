LeetCode Problem #2313: Minimum Flips in Binary Tree to Get Result

Problem Statement:
You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a boolean value (`0` or `1`) and a boolean operator (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, or `NOT`). Each leaf node has a boolean value (`0` or `1`), and each non-leaf node has a boolean operator.

- `0` represents `False`, and `1` represents `True`.
- `AND` is represented by `&`.
- `OR` is represented by `|`.
- `XOR` is represented by `^`.
- `NOT` is represented by `~`.

You are tasked to determine the minimum number of flips required to make the value of the root node equal to the target value (`0` or `1`). A flip means changing a leaf node's value from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of flips required.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node has either `0` or `1` as its value.
- Each node has one of the operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, or `~`.

Example:
Input: root = [some binary tree structure], target = 1
Output: Minimum number of flips required to make the root value equal to the target.

Note: The problem assumes a tree structure, and the input is typically given as a tree node class. You need to traverse the tree and compute the result based on the given operators.
