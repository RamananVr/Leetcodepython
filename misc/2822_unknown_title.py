LeetCode Problem #2822: Maximum Segment Sum After Removals

Problem Statement:
You are given two arrays `nums` and `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. The array `nums` represents an array of integers, 
and `removeQueries` represents the order in which elements are removed from `nums`. After removing an element, the array 
is split into segments of consecutive elements. The sum of each segment is the sum of its elements.

Your task is to find the maximum segment sum after each removal in the order specified by `removeQueries`. Return an array 
`result` of length `n` where `result[i]` is the maximum segment sum after the `i-th` removal.

Constraints:
- `n == nums.length == removeQueries.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= removeQueries[i] < n`
- All the integers of `removeQueries` are unique.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]

Explanation:
- Initially, nums = [1,2,5,6,1], and the maximum segment sum is 14.
- After removing index 0, nums = [2,5,6,1], and the maximum segment sum is 14.
- After removing index 3, nums = [2,5,1], and the maximum segment sum is 7.
- After removing index 2, nums = [2,1], and the maximum segment sum is 2.
- After removing index 4, nums = [2], and the maximum segment sum is 2.
- After removing index 1, nums = [], and the maximum segment sum is 0.
