LeetCode Problem #2068: Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent

Problem Statement:
Two strings are considered "almost equivalent" if the difference in the frequency of any character between the two strings is at most 3. 
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `True` if the two strings are almost equivalent, otherwise return `False`.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.

Example:
Input: word1 = "abcdeef", word2 = "abaaacc"
Output: False
