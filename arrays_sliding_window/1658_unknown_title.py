LeetCode Problem #1658: Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero

Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this modifies the value of `x`.

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce `x` to exactly 0. If it is not possible, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements (3 and 2) to reduce x to zero.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the first three elements (3, 2, 20) and the last two elements (1, 1).

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= x <= 10^9

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a sliding window approach, where each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it).
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
