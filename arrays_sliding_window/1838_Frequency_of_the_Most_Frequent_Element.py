LeetCode Problem #1838: Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

Problem Statement:
The frequency of an element in an array is the number of times it appears in the array. 
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose 
an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by 1.

Return the maximum possible frequency of the most frequent element after performing at most `k` operations.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
- 1 <= k <= 10^5
"""

"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n), where n is the length of the array.
- The sliding window approach iterates through the array once, which is O(n).
- Overall time complexity: O(n log n).

Space Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).
