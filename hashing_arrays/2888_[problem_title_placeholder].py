LeetCode Question #2888: [Problem Title Placeholder]
(Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, LeetCode Question #2888 does not exist. 
If this is a hypothetical or future problem, I will create a generic problem statement based on common LeetCode patterns.)

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the `target`. 
Each pair should be represented as a tuple `(a, b)` where `a <= b`. Return the list of pairs sorted in ascending order.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6
Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]

Constraints:
1. The length of `nums` is between 1 and 10^4.
2. Each element in `nums` is between -10^6 and 10^6.
3. The same pair cannot appear more than once in the output.
4. The order of pairs in the output should be sorted in ascending order.

# Python Solution

    """
    Finds all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the target.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): List of integers.
    target (int): Target sum.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int]]: List of unique pairs sorted in ascending order.

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The function iterates through the `nums` array once, making the time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- The `sorted()` function at the end has a time complexity of O(k log k), where k is the number of unique pairs.
- In the worst case, k can be at most n/2 (if all pairs are unique), so the overall time complexity is O(n + (n/2) log(n/2)) â‰ˆ O(n log n).

Space Complexity:
- The `seen` set stores up to n elements, and the `pairs` set stores up to n/2 pairs in the worst case. Thus, the space complexity is O(n).
