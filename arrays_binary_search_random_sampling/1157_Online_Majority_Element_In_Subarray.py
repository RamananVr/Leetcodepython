LeetCode Problem #1157: Online Majority Element In Subarray

Problem Statement:
Design a data structure that efficiently finds the majority element in a subarray, i.e., the element that appears more than floor((right - left + 1) / 2) times in a subarray.

Implement the `MajorityChecker` class:
- `MajorityChecker(int[] arr)` Initializes the instance of the class with the given array `arr`.
- `int query(int left, int right, int threshold)` Returns the element in the subarray `arr[left...right]` that occurs at least `threshold` times. If no such element exists, return -1.

Constraints:
1. 1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 10^4
2. 1 <= arr[i] <= 2 * 10^4
3. 0 <= left <= right < arr.length
4. threshold > 0
5. The number of queries is at most 10^4.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

1. Preprocessing:
   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once to store the indices of each element.
   - Space Complexity: O(n), as we store the indices of each element in a dictionary.

2. Query:
   - Time Complexity: O(log(k)), where k is the number of occurrences of the candidate element in the array. This is due to the binary search operations (bisect_left and bisect_right).
   - In the worst case, we perform this operation for up to 20 candidates, so the overall complexity is O(20 * log(k)) â‰ˆ O(log(k)).
   - Space Complexity: O(1), as we do not use any additional space during the query.

Overall:
- Preprocessing: O(n) time and O(n) space.
- Query: O(log(k)) time and O(1) space.
