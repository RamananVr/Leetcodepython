LeetCode Problem #2906: Problem Statement

Given the problem number #2906, it appears to be a placeholder or a non-existent problem on LeetCode as of the knowledge cutoff date (October 2023). 
Since there is no official problem statement for #2906, I will create a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes.

Hypothetical Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the `target`. 
Return the pairs as a list of tuples. Each pair should be sorted in ascending order, and the list of pairs should not contain duplicate pairs.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6
Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]

Constraints:
- The array `nums` may contain negative numbers.
- The array `nums` may contain duplicate numbers.
- The solution should not include duplicate pairs.
- The order of pairs in the output does not matter.

# Python Solution
def two_sum_pairs(nums, target):
    """
    Finds all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the target.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): List of integers.
    target (int): Target sum.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int]]: List of unique pairs that sum up to the target.

    seen = set()
    pairs = set()

    for num in nums:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            pairs.add(tuple(sorted((num, complement))))
        seen.add(num)

    return list(pairs)

# Example Test Cases

    target = -6
    print(two_sum_pairs(nums, target))  # Expected Output: [(-1, -5), (-2, -4)]

    nums = [0, 0, 0, 0]
    target = 0
    print(two_sum_pairs(nums, target))  # Expected Output: [(0, 0)]

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The algorithm iterates through the array once, making it O(n).
- The `seen` set operations (add and lookup) are O(1) on average.
- Sorting each pair and adding it to the `pairs` set is O(1) on average.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
- The `seen` set stores up to n elements, where n is the size of the input array.
- The `pairs` set stores unique pairs, which in the worst case could be O(n/2) pairs.
- Overall, the space complexity is O(n).
