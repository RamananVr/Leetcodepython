LeetCode Problem #2981: [Problem Title Placeholder]
(Note: As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, LeetCode Problem #2981 does not exist. 
For the sake of this exercise, I will create a hypothetical problem statement.)

Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the `target`. Each pair should be represented as a tuple `(a, b)` where `a <= b`. Return the list of pairs sorted in ascending order.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6
Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4)]

Constraints:
- The array `nums` may contain duplicate values.
- The solution should not include duplicate pairs.
- The length of `nums` is between 1 and 10^4.
- Each number in `nums` is between -10^6 and 10^6.
"""

# Solution
def find_pairs(nums, target):
    """
    Finds all unique pairs of numbers in the array that sum up to the target.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The input array of integers.
    target (int): The target sum.

    Returns:
    List[Tuple[int, int]]: A list of unique pairs sorted in ascending order.

    seen = set()
    pairs = set()

    for num in nums:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            pairs.add((min(num, complement), max(num, complement)))
        seen.add(num)

    return sorted(pairs)

    target = -6
    print(find_pairs(nums, target))  # Expected Output: [(-5, -1), (-4, -2)]

    # Test Case 4
    nums = [0, 0, 0, 0]
    target = 0
    print(find_pairs(nums, target))  # Expected Output: [(0, 0)]

    # Test Case 5

# Time and Space Complexity Analysis
"""
Time Complexity:
- The function iterates through the array once, making it O(n).
- The `seen` and `pairs` sets have average O(1) insertion and lookup times.
- Sorting the pairs at the end takes O(k log k), where k is the number of unique pairs.
- Overall complexity: O(n + k log k).

Space Complexity:
- The `seen` set stores up to n elements, making its space complexity O(n).
- The `pairs` set stores up to n/2 pairs in the worst case, making its space complexity O(n).
- Overall space complexity: O(n).
